Yeah. So, I landed the other day
and I realized I was so pasty white--

we've been together two and a half years,

-Okay. So you're back.

43
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,412
Yeah, I'm back. It's stressful
being back in LA,

44
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:04,374
but I love the opportunity here
and, like, the money here and, like...

45
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,501
Like, where else can I sell
a $20 million home?

46
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,462
Or like, you know, it's insane.

47
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:14,051
I actually have a potential new listing.
It is around 40 million.

48

It's not done yet, so it'll be done in,
like, two months, but it's sick.

49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,059

everything about it.

-If you have this property--
-It would be life changing.

51
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,438
Once I did something like that,

52

the doors would open completely
for me even more.

I know. That's my problem.

59
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,499
You're so nice
and you're so attractive in that sense,

60
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,459
and you have to pull out the claws now.

61
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,671
I like being friends with people,
and I feel like it's a natural connection

62
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,633
but I don't wanna, like, lose that
in myself just to make money.

63
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,552
Like, I don't want to. I'd rather have
this connection with someone

64
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,638
and they use me 'cause they trust me,

65
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,266
rather than me, like, hurting people
to, like, get farther in life.

66
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,601
I don't want to be that person.

67
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,437
So, yeah, I might be too nice
and I might not.

68
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,606
But I feel like it's gonna be
my advantage in the end.

a $40 million client...

00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,904
I represent some of the largest
manufacturers in China, like billionaires.

You don't have to give me a percentage.

Hi, how are you? Come on in.

00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,670
Nice to meet you.

00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,548
So nice to finally meet you. I feel like
I already know you guys, though.

90
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,800
-Christine, thanks for taking the time.
-Come in.

91
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,552
-[Sepi] Thank you.
-[Christine] Look at the view.

92
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,471
[Sepi] Oh, my goodness.
This view's incredible.

93
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,099
This is pretty big.
It's just over 3,000 square feet.

94
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,185
-It's a good size for you.
-It's what we're looking for.

95
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,853
[Sepi] It's bigger than our current home.

96
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,273
But right now, we have a three bedroom,
and I'm pregnant.

97
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,525
So, this one's on the way
and we have a 14 month old.

98
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,028
[Christine] This is four bedroom
and three and a half baths.

99
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,780
[Sepi] Well, we're sold on the view.

100
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,532
-[Christine] A perfect day, too.
-[Max] I love it. I'm sold on the TV.

101
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,617
[Sepi] Is there a yard?

102
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,702
So there is a little area over here.

103
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,706
A California yard.
I would call that a very LA yard.

104
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,167
You still have the patio area, 
you know, where they can play.

105
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,629
Let's go take a look at the kitchen. 
I think you guys will love it.

106
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,174
This was recently renovated in 2018,
so everything's brand new.

107
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,759
Cappuccino maker.

108
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,054
Come down, make your cappuccino, stare 
at yourself in the mirror in the morning.

109
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,139
-This is a really cool vibe.
-Who's gonna clean this?

00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,307
[Sepi laughs]

111
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,519
I don't know if a mirror behind a stove is
the smartest thing.

112
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,854
-I'm a bit of a cleanness freak.
-He's a clean freak.

113
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,398
Oh, really? So who cleans and who cooks?

114
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,442
-[Max clears throat]
-[Christine laughs]

115
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:21,154
Both! See how unfair this relationship is?

116
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:25,826
She's taking really good care of our son.
I gotta give her that credit. Yeah.

117
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,578
[Christine]<i> </i>I'll be honest.
I really don't normally sell to families,

118
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,914
but Max and Sepi are friends with Brett,

119
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,499
and I think Brett was so busy.

120
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,543
It was nice he, you know, connected us.

121
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,797
And families buying houses in the Hills
isn't necessarily as common,

122
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,299
but it's kinda hip and fun
and they're cute and quirky

123
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,467
and I like that about them.

124
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,594
And here's the rooftop.

125
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,513
-[Sepi] Oh, wow.
-What do you guys think of this view?

126
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,516
-[Max] Oh, my God, it's beautiful.
-[Christine] It's incredible.

127
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,768
[Max] This is the place to entertain.

128
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,603
-[Christine] Yep.
-[Sepi] This is wonderful.

129
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,648
-We host a lot.
-This is the perfect spot.

130
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,442
-[Sepi] Having friends over and stuff.
-[Max] There's a barbecue, TV...

131
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,486
I mean, I like it. I like the house a lot,

132
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,949
I think it's beautiful. I think that
if it was just us two, it's a no-brainer.

133
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,952
But maybe, perhaps, if you have
other things that you could show us

134
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,914
that are more conducive to families.
It would be great if there was a yard.

135
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,333
-But stick to the view. I like the view.
-[Christine] Yeah.

136
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,086
I know you love the view.

137
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,171
-[Max] Cool. Thanks.
-[Sepi] Thanks for showing us.

138
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,215
Of course. I'm so glad you guys came.

139
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,216
[Max] Yep.

140
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,719
[Christine] This couple definitely feel
like best friends

141
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,139
and they have 
that power-couple element that I love,

142
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,601
and I do want the relationship
that they have. Right now...

143
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,063
not so much. I'm working on my career.
But they made me really like it.

144
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,441
It struck a chord with me. 
They're perfect.

[woman] Hi!

157
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,436
-How are you?
-I'm good. How are you?

158
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,146
Good. Good to see you.

159
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,732
You, too. Thank you for showing me this.

160
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,986
This is so beautiful.
 I love how light and airy and open...

161
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,572
And the vaulted ceilings. It's so pretty.

162
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,367
Yeah, and I know you said,
because we've seen so many,

163
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,328
in some of the other ones, 
you mentioned they're just cold.

164
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,372
You know, it's like
they're too contemporary.

165
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,707
You wanted something
a little bit more homey.

166
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,126
Yeah, I feel that with this so much.

167
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,547
[Mary]<i> </i>Finding a home for Emily 
has been a little challenging.

168
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:50,136
She has been looking at all modern homes.
And she said that that's what she wanted,

169
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,598
but I'm starting to notice that
as we're seeing these homes,

170
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,727
she really doesn't like as modern
as she thought she did.

171
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,145
I mean, how great is this?

172
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,399
Just a cute little reading nook.
You know, just chill in the sun.

173
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,109
-I could live here. Right here.
-[chuckles]

174
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,903
[Mary] The house has an amazing flow.

175
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,532
Everything opens up to the outside.

176
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,325
So on a nice day,

177
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,994
just open up all the double doors,

178
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,287
and you have a really nice
indoor-outdoor flow.

179
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,375
All right, 
let's get to the master bedroom.

180
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,419
[Emily] Oh, my God, that's so pretty. Wow.

181
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,879
You can even see your pool down below.

182
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:25,922
[Emily] Oh, I love that.

183
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,966
[Mary] <i>I definitely relate to Emily.</i>

184
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,176
I think we have very similar taste.

185
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,262
I love modern and trendy and cool,

186
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,931
but a little more homey,
kind of like this one.

187
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,517
-I've saved the best for last.
-Wow.

188
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,313
[Mary] The views, obviously, are such
a great selling point on this home.

189
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,525
Yeah. You can actually see all the way
out to the ocean on a clear day.

190
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,361
-Oh, my God, I'm in love with this place.
-[chuckles]

191
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,114
I was hoping you would be.

192
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,450
If you don't buy it,
I would consider buying it.

193
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,745
[Emily] So how much are they asking?

194
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,414
Four-nine-nine-five.
So, just under five million.

195
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,957
-Okay.
-Yeah.

196
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,877
Do you think that they could
come down in price at all?

197
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,963
I think we could probably get it
a little cheaper for you

198
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,133
as long as we come in strong.

199
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,718
I mean, I love it.

200
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,554
But I wanna, like, consult
with my boyfriend first

201
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,183
and kind of see. This is a big move.
This is our first home.

202
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,894
I just wanna make sure
that we're making the right decision.

203
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,481
Of course. Well, think it over
and talk to him, but don't take too long

204
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,858
because I think time is of the essence.

205
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,194
We do need to move on it quickly
if you do want it.

206
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,195
-Okay.
-Okay.

207
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,613
-Yeah, I'll call you.
-Okay.

[Chrishell] Hey.

214
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,380
Well, hi, babe.

215
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,548
Hello, how are you?

216
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:54,052
-You look amazing. Look at you.
-Thank you.

217
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,012
[Chrishell] Well, you inspired my outfit.

218
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,224
-[Christine] I love it.
-[Chrishell] I thought you would approve.

219
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,309
I am loving this sexy new Chrishell.

220
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,144
-Thanks.
-This is amazing.

221
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:07,023
I mean, I love you cute and innocent,
but this is a whole other level.

222
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,358
Thank you for inviting me.

223
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,902
I was like, "How would Christine 
go through my closet?

224
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,986
"Okay, I got it."

225
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,239
Christine definitely
approves this message.

226
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,698
What are you drinking?

227
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,450
I'll just do, like, a Sauv Blanc.

228
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,368
-Sauv Blanc.
-Thanks.

229
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,246
-Start you out with a water as well?
-No, two shots, no water.

230
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,331
But I have to wake up so early for--

231
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,791
You'll be fine, I promise.

232
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,545
This is one of our signature cocktails
turned into a shot.

233
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,712
It's called the La Brea.

234
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,174
Cheers to having me on your side.

235
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,509
[Chrishell] I love that.

236
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,386
I look forward 
to taking you under my wing.

237
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,389
Uh! Cheers. That's so sweet. Thanks.

238
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:49,816
-That was surprisingly easy.
-That was like if a salad was a shot.

239
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,444
So what are your thoughts 
on dinner the other night?

240
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,782
Well, it was nice to see everybody
outside of the office.

241
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,285
-Yeah, it always is.
-There were a few awkward moments.

242
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,705
So, you actually knew before I did
that Maya was pregnant.

243
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,958
I know... Honestly, though,
it was by accident.

244
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,710
I know it was an honest mistake,

245
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:13,548
but just be careful next time because
we're a really small group of people.

246
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,969
So secrets and things get out
and it causes explosions.

247
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,721
Okay. I have no defense.

248
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,183
-I know.
-I literally just still feel so bad.

249
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,726
Just live and learn.

250
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,230
But it seemed like Davina was
really calling you out.

251
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,401
It's frustrating that people are talking--

252
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,321
You did ask me about, like,
does he pay for stuff.

253
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:40,116
Yeah, and I think it's because
you don't really know. You know?

254
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,367
Okay.

255
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,870
You know what it is?
It was just interesting.

256
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:49,000
She kind of brought it up in conversation,
and so I asked her a few questions,

257
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,045
'cause I was trying to understand where 
everybody's concern was coming from.

258
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,464
So I said, 
"Well, is she paying for everything?"

259
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,883
And she was like, "I don't think so."

260
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,969
So I was like, "Okay." 
But then, in front of Mary,

261
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,263
she was kind of like,
"Well, Chrishell said..."

262
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,058
and I was like, "I never said that."
First of all, I don't know them,

263
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,476
so I wouldn't say that.

264
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,603
When Davina threw me under the bus,

265
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,356
I'm not gonna be that person
that just doesn't say something.

266
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,484
So here's the thing
that I love about Davina,

267
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,320
is she's a lot like me. She's no bullshit.

268
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,822
Like, you know, she will say it how it is.

269
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,785
So she's one person 
that you probably wanna be friends with.

270
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,789
If you don't own up 
to the things that you say,

271
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,208
you're gonna get in trouble
in this brokerage. It's small.

272
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,503
So you need to not get your feelings hurt

273
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,005
and don't think that you're being
thrown under the bus

274
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,967
because you're being called out
on something that you've said.

275
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,886
She can't be meek
and she has to be stronger.

276
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,430
And if she's not, she's not gonna last.

277
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,142
As long as you know don't... with me...

278
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,270
I would say, don't... with Davina,

279
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,188
and be careful around Mary.

280
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,815
You'll do fine.

281
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,527
I know you have a tough exterior, but you
seem like a teddy bear on the inside.

282
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,029
I'm bound and determined to see it.

283
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,198
No. I'm a total teddy bear.

284
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,449
I can see it.

285
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,703
I was, like, the nerd in high school.
Everyone made fun of me.

286
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,663
Like everyone said
I would go nowhere in life.

287
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,456
-I swear to God I could cry right now.
-What?

288
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,791
No, I swear to God.

289
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,335
-No! I'm like, "Why am I crying?"
-No.

290
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,046
No, but, seriously, I am a teddy bear.
I really am.

291
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,425
I'm also, like, 
very just to the point and honest,

292
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,678
and sometimes
that comes across, like, the wrong way.

293
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,513
And I hate that. That's not my intention,

294
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,640
'cause people don't have
a sense of humor.

295
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,184
What were you like in high school?
I'm curious.

296
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,103
I come from poverty.

297
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,397
So I was, like, the smelly kid,

298
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,900
'cause sometimes I didn't have
running water. Now, I'm not gonna cry.

299
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,945
Um... But, um, I really relate to you,

300
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,864
because it's one of those things

301
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,075
where it's like people 
would never assume that now

302
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,412
'cause I've worked so hard
to get away from that.

303
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:55,084
It's crazy. Like, you really don't know
what people have been through,

304
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,670
and I think you're so strong. I really do.

305
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,716
But I'm just really happy
that you joined our brokerage,

306
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,510
-and that, um--
-You'll keep me in line.

307
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,388
If I give you a hard time, I'm sorry.
It's not my intention,

308
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,183
I just want you to be professional
and I want people to love you.

309
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,019
So, that's my only intention for you,
I promise.

310
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,563
-I feel a hug coming on.
-I feel a hug coming on!

311
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,982
Come here. Aw, that's so nice.

312
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,943
-Aw. I love--
-Thank you so much for inviting me out.

313
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,862
-[Christine] Of course.
-[Chrishell] It's been so nice.

314
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,905
[Christine] Of course.

315
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,367
<i>♪ Ooh, on top of the world ♪</i>

316
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,791
<i>♪ On top of the world ♪</i>

317
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,585
[Brandon] So they built 
all the way up to the hillside.

318
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,462
As high as they could, yes.

319
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,255
And it doesn't look as tall
from down here,

320
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,300
but I swear it's insane.
So look at the view.

321
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,303
This is not even anything compared
to what else you're gonna see.

322
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,639
I'm looking at those power lines,
and I know you said--

323
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,642
Well, you won't be looking at them
for very long, 'cause they'll be dropped.

324
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,895
He's spending half a million dollars
to drop the powerlines.

325
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,231
[Heather]<i> </i>
It's around 20,000 square feet...

326
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,565
-Okay.
-...which is giant.

327
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,568
And this is actually 
the last home of this size

328
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,320
that is allowed to be built in the Hills.

329
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,489
The city shut it down. So this is it.

330
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,329
So basically when you walk in, on this
side, there's a full gym, two saunas--

331
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,249
-Two saunas? Why would you need two?
-I mean, why wouldn't you?

332
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,459
Atrium with a palm tree.

333
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,712
-That sells it right there.
-Who has a palm tree in their home?

334
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,674
And there's a beautiful movie theater.

335
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,926
-This is all pool right?
-The pool, yeah.

336
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,762
The pool basically wraps 
around the whole house,

337
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,265
so I think that you should get in
and take a little swim.

338
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,394
Oh, I can feel it already.
Are you sure you don't want to get in?

339
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,312
I've decided not to swim today.

340
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,524
You could have rafts in here
and float around like a lazy river.

341
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,609
-[Brandon] A giant swan!
-[Heather] There you go.

342
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,987
-How big is this?
-A hundred and fifty feet long.

343
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,948
Have you ever been 
inside of a pool that big?

344
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,160
At a hotel, yes,
but on a private property, no.

345
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,456
Hello, this is a huge listing.
It'd be the biggest one I've ever had

346
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,791
and the biggest one
at the Oppenheim Group.

347
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,751
It would make a huge statement for me.

348
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,588
So tell your client this is
the last one of this size.

349
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,506
You better jump on it.
It's gonna go quick.

350
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,176
We can do a really good
housewarming party if he buys it.

351
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,053
-Or when. Let's say <i>when </i>he buys.
-Yes!

352
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,430
Let's do it.

353
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,267
<i>♪ You've got to let it go ♪</i>

354

357
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,111
-Me so hungry.
-Oh, I know. Me too.

358
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,868
Oh, my God, I'm starving.

359
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,038
Yeah. Can't wait to get my coffee.

360
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,623
We haven't seen each other a lot.

361
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,082
-You've been really busy.
-I know.

362
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,792
-It's ridiculous.
-Your work, yeah.

363
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,504
I think we saw each other more
when we <i>weren't </i>living together.

364
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,422
[chuckles] Yeah.

365
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,299
[Mary chuckles] This is getting...

366
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,927
-[Romain] Yeah, you're working so much.
-Jeez. It's tough.

367
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,845
Good morning, welcome to Fig.

368
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,764
Hi, my name is Chris.
I'll be your server today.

369
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,307
-Thank you.
-Some menus for you.

370
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,433
All right. Thank you.

371
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,187
I think I'm gonna do 
an egg white omelette with avocado.

372
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,104
[Chris] Perfect.

373
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,399
I'm going to get, like, a toast
with juice and coffee.

374
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,485
-[Chris] Sounds good.
-Cool. Thank you.

375
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,114
-How was your morning?
-It was good. Busy. Yeah.

376
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,909
You know that house
that I showed the other day...

377
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,829
-The one you really liked?
-...on Fremont? Yeah.

378
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,915
-I really want you to see it.
-Yeah?

379
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,166
It's so cool.

380
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:28,798
It feels homey...
and just hip at the same time.

381
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,050
Yeah? What did he say about it?

382
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,886
-Are they gonna make an offer?
-She likes it.

383
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,430
-She likes it a lot.
-[Chris] A latte for you, miss.

384
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,058
-[Mary] Thank you.
-[Chris] For you, sir, whole milk latte.

385
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,309
[Mary] Thank you.

386
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:45,273
We should probably start thinking about
what we're gonna do once we get married,

387
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,733
-like where we're gonna live.
-Mm-hmm.

388
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:53,322
Do we want to keep 
the same kind of, like, condo...

389
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,699
-situation...
-I don't know.

390
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,368
...or do we want a house?

391
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:03,291
Because, after seeing that Fremont house,
I'm, like, that's what I want. [chuckles]

392
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,917
Um, I've thought about it.

393
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:09,213
I don't know if it would be better for us
to just keep living where we are.

394
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,090
Yeah.

395
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,217
Yeah.

396
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,469
But we need to have
a couple extra bedrooms,

397
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,680
for whenever Austin comes out to visit

398
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,599
-or whenever your parents come.
-Mm-hmm.

399
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:24,812
So we need at least two bedrooms,
maybe three so we can have an office.

400
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,022
[chuckles]

401
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,899
Do you want to get a bigger place?

402
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,862
Do you think it's important for us
to have more room, or do you just...

403
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,488
I don't know.

404
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,786
I also will see,
I have to do, you know, more...

405
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,623
-Maintenance and stuff on it. I know.
-Yeah. More, I guess.

406
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,916
I mean, it doesn't need to be huge, but--

407
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,170
No, that's for sure, I mean...
I don't know.

408
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,796
-I guess--
-What style do you like?

409
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,340
You know, with a hot tub.

410
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,800
-With a hot tub?
-Yeah.

411
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,469
What? [laughs]

412
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
A hot tub? Okay.

413
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,140
Or a pool or I don't know,
but something like that.

414
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,185
Well, I mean, you have to have a house,
it's cool, no?

415
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,186
Yeah.

416
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,439
If you're all set,
I'll have the check dropped.

417
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,899
-Perfect, thank you.
-My pleasure.

418
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,276
-Let me know if you need anything.
-[Romain] Thank you.

419
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,195
[gasps] I don't have my--

420
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,155
Do you have your wallet?

421
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,156
Give me your card.

422
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,409
I don't have my card with me, baby.

423
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,537
-It's in my car.
-Uh-huh. I see how you are.

424
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,456
[Romain chuckles]

425
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,958
-Babe, I swear I don't have it.
-Mm-hmm.

426
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,044
I really don't have my wallet.

427
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:34,131
Put a ring on the finger and now you're
like, "Baby, you can pay, right?"

428
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,592
I forgot my card. [laughs]

429
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,178
Yeah, right. I'm looking in there
when we get back.

430
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,723
-Yeah!
-I'm joking.

431
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,979
-This is cute.
-Yeah, this is super cute.

432
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,941
So, you know, 
this area called, like, Hollywood Dell.

433
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:56,070
East Hollywood Hills, 
like old, classic, Spanish.

434
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,407
Yeah, it's pretty cool,
they remodeled the whole property.

435
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,786
[Chrishell] I can't wait 
to see inside. This is pretty.

436
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,997
-Yeah, super nice. Very Spanish.
-[Chrishell] I like all the greenery.

437
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,754
All right. Welcome 
to our Spanish revival new listing.

438
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,215
It's not your typical, 
like, open floor plan.

439
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,925
It's an amazing house.

440
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,932
So you kind of know the stats, right?
You have the setup sheet.

441
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:30,354
Why don't... I'm gonna be your client
and you're just gonna show me the house.

442
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,189
Oh, a little role play.

443
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,026
If I'm a buyer and I'm walking 
into a Sunday open house

444
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,987
and I'm asking the agent questions,

445
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,822
they better know the answers.

446
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,199
Size, price, details.

447
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,327
So I wanted to test Chrishell
and play with her a little bit

448
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,623
just in case she will see the open house
on Sunday when I cannot be there.

449
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:54,003
So this is a beautiful Spanish home
and it's very unique.

450
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,589
Um, you know,
you won't find this everywhere.

451
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,592
A lot of the homes around here
are very modern.

452
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,012
But that's the thing.
When I sent you the listings that I want,

453
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,056
I wanted a modern house, so why
did you bring me to the Spanish one?

454
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,851
-Oh.
-So can we just leave?

455
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,270
-I'm kidding. I'm giving you a hard time.
-My God! [laughs]

456
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,398
I'm kidding, okay.
This is beautiful. All right.

457
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,109
Shit, you really got me. [laughs]

458
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,402
Okay. All right.

459
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:21,530
So, uh, as you see 
this is a huge, nice living space

460
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,199
with a beautiful fireplace.

461
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,160
Yeah, I got eyes. I can see the fireplace.

462
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:30,456
We've got four bedrooms,
four bathrooms--

463
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,541
My phone is ringing. Hold on.
It's my husband.

464
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,918
-Oh, okay.
-Hello?

465
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,213
Yes, I'm seeing a house here,
just a second, bye.

466
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,383
I'm just... I'm giving you a hard time,
'cause this is what clients sometimes are.

467
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,343
-Okay, go ahead.
-Okay.

468
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,260
Ahem.

469
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,471
All right, I wanna see the kitchen.

470
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,098
Okay, I will move you into the kitchen.

471
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:52,645
This next, it is a gorgeous open space.

472
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,106
The kitchen runs beautifully
into the dining room.

473
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,566
Yeah, right? It's pretty.

474
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,319
And you've got an amazing fireplace,
which you never get.

475
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,905
You've got these balconies
outside the kitchen,

476
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,366
which could open it up,
have amazing ambiance.

477
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:10,079
And the really high ceilings
are incredible.

478
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,706
Is this chandelier gonna stay?
Is the seller gonna keep it?

479
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,292
If you want to keep the chandelier,

480
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,295
you would need to specify that
with your offer.

481
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,674
Good answer. Let me tell you.

482
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:26,011
People buy millions of dollars of house
and they argue about little things.

483
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,848
I'm like, "Come on, guys.
You can replace a chandelier."

484
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,475
-But, no, they want that specific one.
-That I knew.

485
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,227
-That was on my test.
-That's a good answer.

486
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,938
So let me give you a round of applause.

487
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,732
-Oh, thank you.
-You passed the audition.

488
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,151
You know, like, real estate is
such a great business

489
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,278
once it's up and going,

490
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,823
but, I mean, you know, my first year,
it took me one year to sell a house.

491
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,658
It was not even a house, it was a condo.

492
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,742
-Really?
-Yeah.

493
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,203
Like, you can say to Jason,
like, "Throw me some bone." Like--

494
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,289
[laughs] Sorry.

495
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,750
I just... It's so cute when you say that.
"Throw me some bone."

496
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,296
Not the real bone, 
like, you know, real estate bone.

497
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,964
-A lead, a listing.
-[Chrishell chuckles]

498
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,757
Okay, so tell it nicely, like,

499
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,135
"Hey, Jason, I do want to be more
in the game,

500
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,764
I just don't want to deal with leases.
Would you co-list with me?" Yeah.

501
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,016
Yeah, I'll ask.

502
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,852
See if he can give it to you. Like,
one listing, one condo, one house.

503
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,186
He doesn't want to go to the Valley.

504
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,814
He doesn't wanna go to the Valley
or East Hollywood Hills

505
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,733
and he's also not gonna cross the 405.

506
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,778
Jason? Where is Jason?

507
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:27,072
-I think if he gets-- [chuckles]
-He's not there.

508
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,783
-He could be.
-Jason is nowhere to be found.

509
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,996
-[Maya] Look how cute the balcony is, huh?
-Oh, this is so cute.

510
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,207
I think it'll sell for sure really quick.

511
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,375
Yeah, I hope so.

512
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,170
I really hope so, 'cause I flew 
from Miami literally last night.

513
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,254
-Really?
-Yeah.

514
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,757
To... do the open houses 
and do the showing.

515
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,842
You don't look like
you flew in last night.

516
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,512
-I know, you know. [chuckles]
-Maybe it's that glow you have going on.

517
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,599
I wish I could say it's the glow,
but it's just so early.

518
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,309
-I know.
-And the thing is, it's like,

519
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,853
you know, I had the miscarriage
and then the other miscarriage.

520
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,356
And then I had a cyst on my ovary.

521
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,607
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

522
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,400
-You got it taken off?
-I did.

523
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,693
-Okay.
-The gynecologist,

524
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,279
she couldn't separate them
and she had to remove the ovary,

525
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,699
so I'm 36 with one ovary now.
It's like, great.

526
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,785
I can't imagine being 
under that much stress.

527
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,537
So if you ever need to decompress,

528
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,499
-I mean, I'm here.
-Thank you, girl. Thank you so much.

529
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,378
-I really appreciate that.
-Of course.

Four-seven-seven-five.

-<i>You think that's the best we can do?</i>

00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,589
I think in this situation, it is.

546
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,843
Four-seven-seven-five

we could win the deal.

[Maya] I think learning 
about real estate development

575
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,506
is very important, 
because eventually I want to do it

or maybe invest with my client
and be part of the deal

On this project, I was really involved.

580
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,520
So I actually engaged 
the architect and the builders.

581
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,523
I reviewed these plans for a month,
I would say,

582
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,149
to make sure everything was good to go.

583
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,069
In fact, we went as far as
to change the name of the street.

584
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,154
-It used to be Pinto Place.
-Yeah, Pinto, right?

00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,783

a different name. It was Pinto Place.

586
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,493
Yeah, now it's Hummingbird Place.

for 30, 40, 50 million.

595
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,268
If you really want to be able
to step up the game

596
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,396
for house flippers and renovations
or for development,

597
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,232
-it's a whole different skill set.
-That's interesting, you know?

598
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,985
Like, my husband is in finance,
and obviously I'm in real estate.

599
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,697
Like, I kind of want to try to convince 
him to start from, like, a small flip

600
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,240
and then just go from there.

601
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,160
-It makes sense.
-Just something that's crossed my mind.

602
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,453
What's up with you guys?
Everything's good?

603
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,706
Yeah. Actually, I'm pregnant.

604
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,124
Shut up.

605
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,500
-Really?
-Yeah, it's very early.

606
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,878
-Come here! Wow.
-Thank you.

607
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,839
Thank you, 
but it's, honestly, it's very early.

608
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,090
Whatever happens, happens.

609
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,634
But because I already had 
two miscarriages,

610
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,470
he's like, "Why don't you just
take it easy and stay more in Miami

611
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,891
and maybe just refer business
to the girls?"

612
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,643
Just so you know, I'm here.
I'm committed. I'm not going anywhere.

613
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,729
Just have to juggle everything, right?

614
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,773
I just want to be perfect
in every aspect in my life.

615
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,859
Being a good wife,

616
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,070
being a good real estate agent
to my clients,

617
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,823
and obviously being a good, perfect mom.

618
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:23,118
And I think you cannot have it perfect.

619
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,746
Something has to give at some point.

620
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,331
I just don't know what.

621
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:31,168
I can't be available for my clients
all the time once I have a newborn.

622
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,753
I'm proud of how
you've handled everything.

623
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,464
-Thank you.
-I can sympathize tremendously

624
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,216
-with what you're going through.
-Can you?

625
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,551
-Well, I can sympathize.
-You don't even have a dog.

626
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,845
I'm pregnant and I'm really... sweaty.

627
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,973
You can show me 
the plans in the office where it's cool

628
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,352
and a glass of, like,
I would say champagne, but lemonade.

629
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,979
-I can't even offer you drinks anymore.
-I know. I'm lame.

630
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:51,980
I have hot flashes.

Let me get an update from everyone here.

648
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,911
Mary, you wanna give us a quick update?

649
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,747
I have some good news.
I just got the offer accepted,

650
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,333
and we are closing the deal
on the Fremont house.

651
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,459
[Maya] Congratulations.

652
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:58,380
We need, like, a bell. Every time
someone closes something, we ring a bell.

653
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,715
Uh, Christine, go ahead.

654
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:05,470
Um... Well, obviously I would love to get
my client Jacob up to the house after, um,

655
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,973
those finishes are put in.
I'd love him to see it

656
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,767
and get a better idea 
of the direction that it's going in.

657
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:14,313
Um, and then I have a showing
for my $14 million house.

658
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,357
This is probably the sixth showing.
I hope it goes good.

659
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,402
Okay, good luck with that, Christine.
Chrishell?

660
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,239
Okay, so, uh... on the Tara Drive,

661
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,199
I'm gonna try to find a new buyer

662
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,285
and I'm gonna try and get
some backup offers.

663
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,911
We're still gonna sell it. I have faith.

-[Heather] What's up?

668

How are you? I'm so sorry I'm late.

669

I have some exciting news.

670
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,263
So I think I have a potential buyer
for the $40 million house.

00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,890
-No way!
-Are you serious?

Christine, you heard that?
You heard that, Christine?

I heard it. I have someone
who's interested as well,

Christine, don't tell me you bought her
the flight ticket already,

678
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,113
like, one-way back to Sweden.

679
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,991
Yeah, she gets miles, coach ticket.

-Norwegian Airlines.
