Oh, my God.

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,442
-Hi!
-[Chrishell] Hi!

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,195
-How are you?
-Good, how are you?

9
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,112
Good.

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,199
[Chrishell]<i> Mount Olympus is an area </i>
<i>that was developed in 1969</i>

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,952
and all the streets are named
after Greek mythology,

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,330
<i>and a lot of the architecture </i>
<i>was very kitschy.</i>

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,124
A lot of the, like, big marble houses

14
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,002
<i>and a lot of that, like, white plaster,</i>
<i>and so it was really hard to sell.</i>

15
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,213
And now we're having a big resurgence.

16
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:50,050
There's been a huge amount 
of construction in that area.

17
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,302
<i>You know, there's all different kinds</i>
<i>of homes up there,</i>

18
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,305
and now it's a really sought after area
in Los Angeles.

19
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,850
I feel like we have to see this first
because this is just so incredible.

20
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:03,146
So this is obviously kind of like
the crown-jewel moment for this home.

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,817
It's just a tiny bit over, this is 5,295.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,734
-Okay.
-Um...

23
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,989
But I think you will see
if there's any wiggle room, it's worth it.

24
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:17,202
[Alexandra] So it is beautiful, don't get 
me wrong, but my only fear is Norman.

25
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,122
He'll jump in the pool, go swim,

26
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,209
and not realize that the edge is an edge.

27
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,422
-So that's my one concern with the pool.
-Oh. Okay.

28
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,508
It doesn't really hit the points
I had envisioned,

29
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,927
and, you know, I'm putting a lot
of faith in you

30
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:38,015
so I'm a little frustrated that it's not
as close to work as we had discussed.

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,268
Um, obviously the price point,
it's a little higher.

32
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,771
Right. Okay.
So I can work on something that's closer.

33
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:48,150
As of right now,
it's a really small circumference

34
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,819
so I'll try and scrounge up
some other listings.

35
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,697
Okay. So just so you know,
I took some time off work today

36
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,617
to get here, so I just don't wanna be
looking at houses

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,785
that don't hit the points
that we had discussed.

38
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,245
And obviously my time is important,

39
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,206
so, just, I wanna see the home 
that we had discussed.

40
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,500
Okay.

-[Jason] Team?
-[Mary] Yeah?

49
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,106
Can we get together
for the meeting, please?

50
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,900
Your favorite hour of the week.

51
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,109
[Chrishell] Yes, sir.

52
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,156
-Can you get through?
-Yeah.

53
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,493
All right, all right, let's get going.

54
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,996
Well, I wanna get an update
from everyone. Chrishell?

55
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:48,835
So there was that client Alexandra who
wanted to meet with both me and Christine,

56
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,212
which was a little odd.

57
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,839
Wait, so you guys were actually competing
against each other?

58
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,884
-We didn't know that going in--
-We didn't realize that.

59
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,886
But that's what it turned out to be.

60
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,931
-It was so awkward.
-Like an interview process or something?

61
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,225
[Alexandra] <i>After much thought...</i>

62
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,852
<i>I've decided to go with Chrishell.</i>

63
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,482
Yeah, like all of a sudden
I felt like I was in a audition,

64
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,234
like trying to get the part.

65
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,194
Which you should be pretty good at.

66
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,446
Well, I did get the part, but...

67
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,614
-[laughs]
-[Christine] She got the part.

68
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,741
No, I'm honestly glad that you have it.
I think it's--

69
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:20,826
[coughs] Bullshit!

70
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,412
-No, I'm serious.
-[Brett] No, I had something in my throat.

71
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,665
But wait, it's not the greatest thing.

72
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,918
I just showed her a house, and 
unfortunately, she was a little hard on me

73
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,255
because the owner of Wag
has to be able to walk to work.

74
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,464
Where does she work?

75
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,550
She works down the street on Sunset.

76
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,053
Oh, Chrishell, but I-- 
I'm actually getting a listing in--

77
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,557
Well, we got the listing. We're just gonna
put it on the market in two, three weeks,

78
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,309
-on the corner of Queens and Sunset.
-Oh.

79
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,062
Like, literally right here.
You can see Wag and the office.

80
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,940
We're gonna list at 4,795.

81
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,817
They're beautiful,
contemporary, sexy house.

82
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,695
Yes, this could work!
I'm getting so excited.

83
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,655
This is exactly
why we have these meetings.

84
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,656
So, perfect.

85
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,951
Yeah, I'm happy to show it to you.
Like, I mean, that's a great house.

86
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,328
[Brett] Okay, well, great.
Heather, what about you?

87
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,583
Christine and I are actually gonna go look
at one of her properties

88
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,709
for one of my clients.

89
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,794
I have a feeling 
that your client's really gonna like it.

90
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,714
It's very modern,
Jason-sized, like, bachelor-esque.

91
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,966
-You sure you guys can do a deal together?
-[laughs]

92
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,052
-[Brett] I know, it's good that you asked.
-They're always bickering with each other.

93
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,973
So we have Christine showing
Heather a house,

94
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,851
and then Maya,
you'll show Chrishell your listing. Great.

95
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,395
-Double end, I guess.
-Let's double end this stuff, guys.

96
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,897
All right, well, thank you, Heather.

97
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,399
It looks like everyone's got
a lot going on.

98
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,819
Remember the sponsorship at 
the Food on Foot Organization next week.

99
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,946
-[Maya] When is that?
-Next week, next Sunday.

100
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,698
[Maya] 
That'll be fun. Yeah, that'll be fun.

101
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,951
And Brett and I have five new listings
coming on this week.

102
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:49,539
So we'll send you photos
and specifications as soon as possible.

103
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,041
-Yeah.
-Killing it.

104
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,167
Good job, guys.

105
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,752
Let's keep at it. Thank you, everyone.

106
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,462
[Chrishell] That's a good one.
We're in a good spot, guys.

107
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,756
Chrishell, let's see 
who double ends this first.

108
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,425
Me and you 
or, like, Christine and Heather.

-Okay.

[Christine] The house manager 
left it open for me.

120
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,419
-Ooh.
-Okay.

121
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,462
Wow.

122
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,548
-What do you think?
-I love it.

123
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,426
-It's incredible.
-Smells new and fresh, huh?

124
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,469
Everything's all new.

125
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,887
Tell me about your client.

126
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,098
So he's a plastic surgeon.

127
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,057
Wow.

128
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,227
-And he's a bachelor, so it's just him.
-Okay.

129
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,898
He's looking for something this style
for sure, like, sexy, clean, very sleek.

130
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,360
-This is a five-bedroom, four-bath.
-Okay.

131
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,613
Just under 5,000 square feet
and it's going for 10,695.

132
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,032
[Heather] I think 
this is gonna be very tempting.

133
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,117
The view, are you kidding me?

134
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,995
-The house has it's own hiking trail, too.
-Stop it.

135
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,037
It's incredible.

136
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,834
I love that we're doing this together.

137
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,835
I know

138
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,170
This is our first deal together.
It's exciting.

139
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,089
That's why we both have to come through.

140
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,551
It's not often that we work together
in the office.

141
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,804
However, we try to as much as we can
because we want to double end a property

142
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,180
to get a higher commission.

143
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,808
She's not my first pick,
but it doesn't matter to me.

144
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,769
As long as I'm on top and I'm number one,

145
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:39,065
I'm willing to work with anyone
to be at the top of my game.

146
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,818
Hell, I'll work with Satan if I need to.
I mean... [chuckles]

147
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,446
Do you need help? You got it?
Do you need my strength?

148
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,614
-Yes.
-[chuckles]

149
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,116
-Oh, shit, sorry.
-[both chuckle]

150
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,367
[Christine] Okay.

151
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,579
Teamwork, see? And now I'm sweating.

152
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,789
-Wow!
-It's amazing, right?

153
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,083
[Heather] So, what's down here?

154
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,294
-So I'm gonna show you the master.
-Okay.

155
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,341
-This is the master.
-It's really pretty.

156
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,386
[Christine] Fireplace.

157
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,930
[Heather] Oh, that's sexy. I love that.

158
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,433
This view is totally seamless,
which continues into the bathroom.

159
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,770
[Heather] <i>I'm hoping to get a deal done.</i>
<i>That's most important.</i>

160
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:21,399
Then if Christine and I can maybe build
some type of better working relationship

161
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,027
and get this deal done,
then we're both gonna be happy.

162
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,949
You know, I've always said that I think
Christine has a sweet side deeper down

163
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,744
that she doesn't show me, and if 
she would, we would get really close

164
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,371
and, I think, get along well.

165
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,249
We're grown women. I think by now
we should be able to put things aside,

166
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,378
work together, and move on from things.

167
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,922
-[Christine] Here's the pool area.
-[Heather] I love it.

168
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,341
So what do you think
your client will think of the house?

169
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,759
-I think he's gonna like it.
-Okay.

170
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,887
I'm concerned about the price,
but that's ultimately up to him.

171
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,182
When do you think we could come back?
How easy is it to show?

172
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,602
So, you know, as long as you give me
some time to wait for him to reply--

173
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,647
He's usually pretty good.
So just let me know a time...

174
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,565
Okay, let me text him actually right now.

175
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,276
-Probably a weekend or maybe evening?
-Yeah, whatever works.

176
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,570
Cool. Let's figure it out
and get it done, girl.

177
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,030
Okay, sounds good.

178
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,407
-Thanks for showing me.
-Of course!

179
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,953
-Let's go check out that pilate room.
-I have to walk all the way up there?

00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,514
-This is so beautiful.
-[Maya] I told you.

186
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,307
-[Chrishell] The location is perfect.
-[Maya] It's super nice.

187
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:40,145
Yeah, like, look at the finishes, like,
high ceilings, recessed lighting.

188
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,688
It's a chef kitchen.

-Oh, my god, there's so much space.
-Are you looking for Jason again?

It's not too big.

194
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,870
<i>It's, like, one minute walking </i>

195
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,373

198
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,674
who just wanna be close to the action.

199
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,342
-[Chrishell] Come in!
-[Alexandra] Hi.

200
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,721
Hi. I'm Alex, nice to meet you.
Hi. Good to see you.

201
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,806
Good to see you, too. Okay.

202
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,976
I took everything you said into account,

203
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,352
so please come this way.

204
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,730
You still get to keep
your infinity edge pool.

205
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,817
[Alexandra] I love the open floor plan
and the windows.

206
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,153
-The sliding door is really nice.
-[Maya] Yeah.

207
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,696
Double-pane windows, by the way.

208
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,323
[Alexandra] Oh, wow. I love this pool.

209
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,451
And it's still pretty private
and you have the view,

210
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,036
-so you get everything, really.
-Yeah.

211
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,790
Even though, being straight on Sunset,
it still feels very cozy and homey.

212
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,876
And I love it. I can see my office
from here. It's perfect.

213
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,961
You are literally
the first person to see this,

214
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,923
because it hasn't even hit
the market yet, so that's pretty special.

215
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,258
-That's awesome. I really like this house.
-Shall we see the rest?

216
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,260
[Alexandra] Yeah. I love the fireplace.

217
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,804
-Is it marble?
-[Maya] Yeah, it's marble.

218
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,263
Yeah, it's super cool, I love it.

219
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,184
You also have, like, a wine cooler,
a nice open kitchen.

220
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,937
I like this kitchen layout.
It's really beautiful.

221
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,563
[Chrishell]
<i>When you're working with new clients,</i>

222
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,273
<i>you try to get a feel for who they are.</i>

223
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,234
It's hard to read Alexandra

224
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:14,405
because her emotions are all, like, within
this one little, you know, kind of bubble.

225
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,450
<i>Being a really animated person,</i>
<i>if I love something, you're gonna know it.</i>

226
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:23,081
When Alexandra likes something, she'll say
"Wow, I really like this house."

227
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,917
<i>When she doesn't like something,</i>
<i>she will say,</i>

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,836
"I don't think this is the house for me."

229
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,464
[chuckles] So it's hard to tell.

230
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,842
And you've got 
the light, white oak floors.

231
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,719
-It really brightens up the room.
-[Maya] Totally, yeah.

232
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,556
And obviously this is your suite.
This is your section.

233
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,601
Oh, wow. Yeah. The view's gorgeous.
Yeah, I like this space, it's really nice.

234
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,229
-[Maya] Wanna show you the master bath.
-[Alexandra] Oh, wow.

235
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,814
[Maya] Shower, bathtub.

236
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,899
[Alexandra] Oh, my gosh.

237
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,611
I walk right into the shower,
and it has a rain shower, which is good.

238
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,531
You can literally be naked here
and no one sees you.

239
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,074
[all chuckle]

240
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,743
-[Maya] A very large balcony...
-[Alexandra] Nice.

241
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,538
-...with fireplace again.
-I love the fireplace.

242
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,039
[Maya] And it's all enclosed.

243
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,791
[Alexandra] 
Yeah, the master was beautiful.

244
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,543
-The views are pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah.

245
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,379
So, four point eight.

246
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,465
Again, off market,
would love to do a deal with Chrishell.

247
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,467
Can you give us a second
to talk for a minute?

248
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,469
No. I'm kidding, of course.

249
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,181
-Go ahead, talk, I'm gonna go outside.
-Okay, thank you.

250
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,017
-Yeah. So you really stepped up your game.
-Yes!

251
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,770
It definitely hits all the points
that we talked about last time so...

252
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,856
I mean, I know it's a little over.

253
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,649
I know you said four-six is the top.

254
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,359
Do you know when it goes on the market?

255
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,069
-Yes. In two weeks.
-Okay.

256
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,655
But that doesn't mean she can't show it
to other people off market,

257
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,115
-in-house as well.
-Yeah.

258
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,034
I think just give me a day or two
to just sit on it

259
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,203
-and, you know, take it all in.
-[Chrishell] Of Course.

260
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,997
Okay, take one last, like, mental image.

261
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,999
-I do love it. [chuckles]
-Sleep on it.

00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,126
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Thank you.

263
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,545
-Okay, we'll talk tomorrow.
-Yes, sounds good.

264
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,423
All right yes. 
Here, let me get the door for you.

265
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,968
Maybe the next time you'll be getting 
the door for me. [chuckles]

266
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,136
-Bye.
-Bye.

-Yes?
-[Maya] All clear?

00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,685
[Chrishell] All clear.

270
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,729
So when are you gonna write me an offer?

271
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,189
Um, so we'll see.

272
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,734
And honestly, like, with the price,
we're asking four point eight,

273
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,737
-a little bit of flexibility.
-A little bit of flexibility.

-Four point six.
-A little bit, a little bit. No.

282

really lets people that want

283
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,223

00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,459
[man] Thank you. 
Thank you all for doing this.

299
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,587
So the Food on Foot charity event 
is important to me

300
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,132
because it's something that I struggled
with when I was a kid.

301
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,885
<i>I think it's so imperative </i>
<i>to give back to people,</i>

302
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,972
<i>not only because you should,</i>
<i>but it makes you feel good.</i>

303
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,141
Like, this might change their life,
you know?

304
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:30,810
Hi.

305
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,020
-Hi.
-You're welcome.

306
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,230
-Hi, how are you?
-I'm good. How are you?

307
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,857
-How are you?
-You're welcome.

308
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,818
Oh, you're so cute. Hi, cutie!

309
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,904
Can I give this to you? Thank you.

310
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,448
Here you go.

311
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,951
I think there's a huge stigma
with growing up in poverty

312
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,245
or, you know, being homeless.

313
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,289
<i>I mean, </i>
<i>I think these charities are important</i>

314
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:55,418
<i>because when you treat people</i>
<i>in a bad situation with respect,</i>

315
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,296
that's when they really feel uplifted

316
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,757
<i>and maybe they can garner </i>
<i>some change in their life.</i>

317
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,009
It's a moving thing to be a part of.

318
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,428
Thank you, guys. Thanks for doing this, J.
It was awesome.

319
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,931
It was honestly, like, so nice being here
and, you know, just smile to people

320
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,601
and make eye contact and give them--

321
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:16,064
That's what like, for me, our family was
one of the families in that line,

322
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:20,777
so it's been, like, so gratifying
to be here but also, like, it's hard--

323
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,989
Yeah, a little emotional just because,
you know, when you see that boy it's like

324
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,908
I remember being in that line, so...

325
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,369
I'm so happy that you guys did this.

326
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,871
-I'm sorry. I'm such a mess today.
-Oh, my gosh.

327
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,122
Sorry.

328
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,666
[Brett] <i>It was interesting to learn</i>
<i>that Chrishell had been homeless.</i>

329
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,712
I mean, I can tell she's a tough woman,
and, uh, I didn't know why,

330
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,297
<i>but it's in keeping with her personality.</i>

331
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,925
<i>You know, she doesn't back down.</i>
<i>She doesn't get intimidated.</i>

332
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,427
And that makes sense because 
if you come from that type of background

333
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,639
<i>to where she is right now,</i>
<i>that tells you something about somebody.</i>

334
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,099
I admire her even more now.

335
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:55,561
Anyway, so I just think it's so awesome
that you guys put your time and effort

336
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,106
and money towards such a great cause.
It's really cool.

337
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,651
When Chrishell revealed she was homeless,
I honestly was shocked.

338
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,695
I-- I had no clue that she ever 
went through anything like that

339
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:09,409
and I think with all of us in the office,
you know, we're so focused on real estate

340
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,244
<i>and work and money and success,</i>

341
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,288
and I don't know 
a lot about all their childhoods.

342
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,998
And I don't think 
they know a lot about mine,

343
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,877
and I think if we sat down and really got
to know each other on a deeper level,

344
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,255
we would have more empathy
towards each other.

[Chrishell]
The Food on Foot thing was really fun.

366
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,063
I feel like it was, 
like, a bonding experience.

367

Do you guys feel closer?

It was a great event.

369
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,735
What did you like best about it?

370
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,905
Well, I feel like everyone knows this now
so it's not really secret,

371
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,617
but, um, I used to be homeless 
when I was a kid a couple times.

372
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,702
-Really?
-[Chrishell] Yeah, just kind of, like,

373
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,414
one of those things that now I just, 
like, try to work with the charities.

374
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,874
-Really cool.
-Yeah.

375
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,419
I mean, I don't know. I heard from
a couple of the other girls that she was,

376
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,756
you know, like,
homeless for a week or something

377
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,133
or they lived in a tent or in her car.
It doesn't matter.

378
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,635
Obviously, they were struggling

379
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,304
<i>and it sucked, but I have stories, too.</i>
<i>Everyone does.</i>

380
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,849
So are you saying it
to gain sympathy points? I don't know.

381
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,184
Well, you were missed.

382
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,731
Um, I was actually at Burning Man
that I had planned for months.

383
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,609
-What's Burning Man?
-It's a festival in the desert in Nevada.

384
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,987
-[Chrishell] Oh, it's like a concert?
-No, it's actually like an art festival

385
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,698
and a lot of camps.
It's really about art and culture, yeah.

386
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,952
Oh, well, we'll have to do it
again, I guess. You missed out.

387
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,037
It was like--
I think it was like really special.

388
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,748
You know, the charity, I think it's nice
to just kind of, like,

389
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,042
get us out of our own little bubbles 
where it's like--

390
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,544
[Davina] Yeah, no question.

391
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,671
You know, even if it's something 
like that, it's, like, that's not--

392
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,173
You're doing it because you want to,
but there's some people,

393
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,633
they don't have any other options.

394
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,261
Like, for instance, like, how much was
your ticket for Burning Man?

395
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,638
Four hundred ninety-five dollars.
But it was for a week, you know?

396
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,265
Right, but I'm just saying, like,

397
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,559
we do those kind of things
and you don't even think.

398
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,810
How much was your dress?

399
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,353
-This one?
-Yeah.

400
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,772
Ooh, girl. Ooh...

401
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,526
But that's my point, like, giving back
and like reminding yourself--

402
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,737
It was an experience that totally changes
your, like, perspective.

403
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,573
It's like traveling, you know? So...

404
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,993
So, anyway. Yeah, I'd love to join
next time with you as well.

405
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,329

I don't know.
I haven't thought about it. Um...

00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,627
-You haven't thought about it at all?
-I mean...

423
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:53,591
I think sometime next year 
would be the best for us.

424
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,594
I wanna do, like, destination,
someplace, I think.

425
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:01,182
Can be more expensive, but... Tropical?

426
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,267
I'm good with that.

427
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,727
Yeah? Your family won't mind?

428
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,520
I don't think so.

429
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:11,817
So we could just do a destination wedding
and then do like a reception in France?

430
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,319
I guess it could work.

431
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,905
-I don't know, but...
-Are you sure?

432
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,281
You just like, "No I gotta--"

433
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,700
No, I-- I like the...

434
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,663
-I like the tropical idea.
-Yeah.

435
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,749
No matter what, unless we do in France,
and even in France,

436
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,335
it doesn't mean that everyone's
gonna be able to come, you know,

437
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,920
with work, with, you know, everything.

438
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,548
So it doesn't matter really where we do it

439
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,635
if I have to pick I guess
it would be better... uh...

440
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,220
and uh...

441
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,265
much fun to do it
somewhere different. Right?

but you know, it's like girls say,
"Oh, I want a big wedding.

446
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,902
I want a small wedding. Or I want it at
the beach. Or I want it in the mountain."

447
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,114
Or whatever it is, you know what I mean?
I really don't care.

Hey, has somebody given Nico a treat
and Zelda a treat?

452
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,761
Um, I don't think so.

453

I'm not gonna mention names, but...

454
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,099
[Chrishell] 
Sorry, one second. I have to take this.

455
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,185
Hello, Alexandra, how are you?

456
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,520
<i>Hi, how are you doing?</i>

457
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,105
-Good. Good.
<i>-Good.</i>

458
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:37,445
<i>So, I wanna talk about the Queens house.</i>
<i>I wanna go ahead and put an offer on it.</i>

459
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,905
You do? That is great news.

460
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,282
I was hoping you would say that.

461
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:47,288
<i>So, um, my offer is four point five.</i>
<i>I wanted to go ahead and see about that.</i>

462
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,458
Okay. Just give me one second,
if you will.

463
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,628
The other agent is in the office 
right now, so can you hold that thought?

464
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,839
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Okay, one second. One second.

465
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,383
[Chrishell whsipers] Maya!

466
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,968
-Okay.
-What's up?

467
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,220
So, thank you for showing me
your lovely property.

468
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,972
-I have an offer for you.
-No way!

469
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,307
-Yes.
-Are you serious?

470
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,684
Yes. Okay. 
We're coming in at four point five,

471
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,936
but it's all cash, 20-day close.

472
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,564
I like the terms. Those are great.

473
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,733
I know my seller gonna like that.

474
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,360
Four point five, uh...

475
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,071
I mean, look, 
we took the listing at four point eight,

476
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,866
I know they are 
a little bit flexible with the price.

477
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,826
-I just don't know how much flexible.
-Okay.

478
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,330
But I like the terms and I think we can
try to meet somewhere in the middle.

479
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,208
Okay. Well, or it could be
the ending point?

480
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,751
-Uh...
-[Chrishell chuckles]

481
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,836
It's not gonna be the ending point,

482
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,714
but it's a great house
and I know she loved it. I saw it.

483
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,509
So let me make a call to my client
and see what she says.

484
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,426
Okay.

485
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,304
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Rachel?

486
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,349
<i>-Hi, Maya.</i>
-I have some good news.

487
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,977
I was showing Queens and we have an offer.

488
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,646
<i>Oh, my God, that's amazing news.</i>

489
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,481
<i>Maya, you're incredible.</i>

490
00:21:55,564 --> 00:22:00,319
I know. [chuckles] Okay, so here's 
the thing, it's all cash, 20-days close,

491
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,696
and they are coming at four point five.

492
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,324
<i>I mean, the all cash </i>
<i>and the 20 day sounds amazing.</i>

493
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,702
It's like-- 
Yeah, no bank, no appraisal contingency.

494
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,997
<i>Everything sounds good,</i>
<i>except for the four point five.</i>

495
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,582
<i>You know how I feel about my house,</i>

496
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,585
<i>Maya, and I feel like</i>
<i>that's way under what we were asking.</i>

497
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,087
Here's the thing, Rachel,

498
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,632
the agent that's bring me the offer,
she's like literally standing right by,

499
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,886
so please give me your number back and
we'll try to do the best to make a deal.

500
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,431
<i>Okay. Well I don't think I can go less</i>
<i>than four point six five.</i>

501
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,560
Four point six five. Okay, let me see.

502
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,103
-Alexandra?
<i>-Yeah?</i>

503
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:40,317
Okay, so, um, they have agreed
to accept four point six five.

504
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:45,698
<i>Can we meet somewhere in the middle?</i>
<i>Potentially four point six?</i>

505
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,825
-Is that your best and final?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

506
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,870
Four point six is the highest she can go,
that's best and final.

507
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,664
-Are you sure that's her best and final?
-All cash, all cash.

508
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,749
-Twenty-day closing.
-I know.

509
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,168
[Chrishell] Four point six.
Just saying, that's pretty good.

510
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,670
Let's see what my client says.

511
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,714
-Rachel?
<i>-Hi, Maya.</i>

512
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,841
So the client bid come up

513
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:08,345
to a best and final,
and she's offering four point six.

514
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,306
<i>You think this is the best</i>
<i>we can do, Maya?</i>

515
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,226
I don't know if I can get you the same
if we go on the market,

516
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,145
but just from experience,

517
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,356
the first offer is usually
always the best offer.

518
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,567
I do think it's-- it's a very good one.

519
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,156
<i>Okay, Maya, I think I'm sold.</i>
<i>Four point six it is.</i>

520
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,825
<i>I trust you, so let's go for it.</i>

521
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,785
All right. 
I'm gonna send you the paperwork.

522
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,580
<i>-Sounds good. Thank you, Maya.</i>
-No problem.

523
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,497
<i>-Bye.</i>
-Bye.

524
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,333
Good? Good? We got a deal?

525
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,293
Wait, I gotta tell her, hold on.

526
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:44,632
Alexandra, I have very good news for you.
Congratulations, she accepted your offer.

527
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,717
<i>-Awesome.</i>
-Yay!

528
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,802
<i>-Thank you so much.</i>
-[Chrishell] <i>Yes!</i>

529

<i>No, thank you. I can't wait.</i>
<i>This house is absolutely stunning.</i>

530
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,350
<i>Congratulations. Okay, bye.</i>

531
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,686
<i>[Maya] I'm so excited. </i>
<i>Like, I can't believe it.</i>

532
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,481
Like, I was supposed to put it 
on the MLS, like, literally in ten days.

533
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,733
-Good job, hon. Maya.
-You taught me that.

534

-A double ending. Double ending the deal.
-Good job, girls.

-Good job, ladies.
-Good job, Chrishell. Both of you.

537
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,035
-Thanks, guys. Okay, I have work to do.
-Wow, so excited.

538
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,662
-Chrishell.
-Yes?

539
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,538
Send me everything in Docusign.

540
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,583
-Okay, I'm doing it right this second.
-Cool.

541
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,876
Let me know if you need help.

542
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,795
-Okay.
-She probably does.

543
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:28,258
[Maya] Christine, didn't you just get 
ditched by a five-million-dollar buyer?

00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,680
Hi, how are you?

553
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,932
Um, we have a problem.

554
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,225
[Heather] What?

555
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,601
Don't scare me. What?

556
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,105
I can't get into the house
and the house manager's not here.

557
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,565
-What do you mean--
-I don't know.

558
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,567
-Maybe they're in there--
-I don't know.

559
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,694
-You tried knocking? Banged?
-That's what I tried.

560
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,530
Hello?

561
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,869
So you don't have 
the house manager's number, nothing?

562
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,121
No, he didn't give it to me.
Just said he's gonna be there.

563
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,457
-What about the maid? You don't have her?
-No.

564
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,626
Okay. It's not in your emails,
like, the owner didn't give you anything.

565
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,420
No. No.

566
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,797
Dr. Tsai's gonna be here,
like, any minute.

567
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,218
-Uh-oh. This is such bad timing.
-Let's just pretend nothing's going on.

568
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,344
[Dr. Tsai] Hey.

569
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,597
How are you doing, Heather?

570
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,348
-Good to see you.
-You, too.

571
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,768
-Thanks for coming to show me this house.
-Thanks for coming.

572
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,978
-I'm Christine.
-Roger Tsai, nice to meet you.

573
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,730
All right, 
so I'm excited to see this house.

574
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,231
Heather's been saying 
a lot of good stuff about it.

575
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,317
Yeah, we have 
a little bit of a problem right now.

576
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,361
The house manager that was supposed
to unlock it is running behind.

577
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,406
I'm trying to get ahold of my client,
but he's in Europe...

578
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,699
Do you know how much longer he will be?

579
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,410
[sighs] I'm not sure. I'm hoping 
he's just running behind in traffic.

580
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,079
-I mean, I can wait for a little bit.
-I understand.

581
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,206
But, I mean, did he pick up his phone?
Did he answer or--

582
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,709
-[Christine] No. 
-[Heather] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

583
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,294
I'm gonna try to call him again.

584
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,339
If you wanna look at the view over here,
it's really gorgeous.

585
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,758
Can you leave him a message maybe, too?

586
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,844
Yeah. I left a few messages.
I will again, though.

587
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,846
Okay, so peek your head around.

588
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,058
Yeah. I do have other commitments
that I have to kind of go do, so...

589
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,186
-you know, I just can't wait forever.
-If he doesn't come--

590
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,774
Hey, guys, so I'm so sorry.
I can't get ahold of him right now.

591
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,359
-Okay.
-I know you have to go.

592
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,028
She built up this excitement.
Now I'm a little bummed out.

593
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,446
-[Christine] I know. I understand.
-Yeah. Okay.

594
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,574
I was just as excited to show it
as you are to see it.

595
00:26:57,658 --> 00:27:00,285
You know, 
this is embarrassing for me. Um...

596
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:04,081
But there's a lot of moving parts here
when he's in another country

597
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,793
and I'm depending on someone else.
So I'm not making excuses,

598
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,628
but I mean, 
it's not ideal and I apologize.

599
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,671
-Thanks so much. 
-It was good to meet you.

600
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,047
-It was so nice to meet you. Okay.
-Take care.

601
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,298
-Bye.
-See you soon.

602
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,009
I'm so sorry.

603
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,721
[Christine] This is so embarrassing.

604
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,056
This can't happen again.

605
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,559
If I bring Dr. Tsai back up here, <i>if</i> I do,

606
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,894
because I'm kind of embarrassed
at this point

607
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,397
to even wanna do this.

608
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,149
Don't put this on me.

609
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,776
-Don't put this on you? Excuse me.
-I didn't do this on purpose.

610
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,695
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

611
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,822
-You think I wanna sit here--
-Stop raising your voice at me.

612
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,783
Don't raise your voice at me 
and get defensive. I know you're pissed.

613
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,285
This is irritating for me, too.

614
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,495
I thought we could work together,
but clearly we can't,

615
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,248
and this is not gonna work
because you're yelling at me,

616
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,167
you're getting defensive,
and I can't do it.

617
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,003
I mean, I always knew 
she could be bitchy and aggressive,

618
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,047
<i>but my client may never wanna see</i>
<i>this house again</i>

619
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,550
or see another home with me in general,

620
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:00,554
so to turn it around on me, yell at me,
be aggressive to me,

621
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,889
it's so uncalled for.

622
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,807
Okay, Heather, you know, 
I don't give a flying...

623
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,143
if you wanna work with me or not
'cause one way or another,

624
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,353
this house will get sold.
So if it's not from your client,

625
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,396
I don't care who it is.

626
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,523
You're just like a big tough girl,
aren't you?

627
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,568
-I'm not trying to be friends with you.
-You've made that clear.

628
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:18,655
Business is business.
Like, I'm sorry that this got...

629
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,366
Like, I apologize for that.
I genuinely do,

630
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,453
but if you're gonna tell me you don't
wanna work with me, good luck with that.

631
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,372
Good luck with your home
since you can't get your shit together.
