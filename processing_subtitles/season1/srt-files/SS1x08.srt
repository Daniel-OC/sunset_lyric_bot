[Christine] How cute is 
this space right now?

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,806
-[Maya] It's so cute.
-[Christine] Do you love it?

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,225
This is perfect.

6
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,311
Our agents have been
so successful this year.

7
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,896
This is our best year ever.

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,441
Chrishell just closed Queens,
and everyone's been kicking ass.

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,361
So we wanted to throw 
a cocktail party to celebrate.

10
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,530
-Hi!
-Oh, hi!

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,447
[Jason] Hey.

12
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,991
[Mary] Mmm, how are you?

13
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,327
-[Jason] Hey, babe.
-[Mary] I'll get you some champagne.

14
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,371
Cheers.

15
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,625
-[Maya] Slow down on the champagne!
-[cheering]

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,170
-Mike.
-Maya. Nice to meet you.

17
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,380
[Mike] Maya, nice meeting you.

18
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,715
[Jason] Brett's wasted, so...

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,677
-Who's this?
-This is Alex.

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,805
Finally I meet you! Hi. I'm Heather.
Nice to meet you.

21
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,099
See, her boyfriend exists.

22
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,267
Your boyfriend--

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,519
-Well, my boyfriend--
-Where is your imaginary boyfriend?

24
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,437
My girlfriend's not here, so...

25
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,398
[Heather] You don't have a girlfriend.

26
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,315
Oh.

27
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,401
-[Maya] That is good.
-Exactly.

28
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,194
I'd rather have a man that's working

29
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,405
than a man that's sitting around
doing nothing, right?

30
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,740
-He's a professional athlete.
-Exactly. And he's hot.

31
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:14,741
[woman] Boo-ya!

32
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,744
Oh, I want to tell you, like, good job
on Queens. Cheers, girl.

33
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,247
-Thank you.
-We just closed Queens.

34
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,456
Yeah, I know. That's awesome.

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,042
-Yay!
-I mean, beginner's luck, but you know...

36
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,212
-[Maya] Come on!
-There was a lot of work involved.

37
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,463
First rodeo!

38
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:33,552
It's not my first or second or third,
but it is my biggest, so...

39
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,095
-[Maya] Good job on that one.
-Thank you.

40
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,430
Yeah.

41
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,932
And hopefully your client is happy, and--

42
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:43,061
Davina is very supportive of you.
Is everything okay between you guys?

43
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,022
[mouths] I don't know.

44
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,065
I don't think Davina has it out for me.

45
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,986
I just think it's one of those things
where when you do something well,

46
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,196
she's thinking in her head,
"That should've been me."

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,283
So it's hard for her 
to be happy for other people,

48
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,786
but you don't have to be a dick.
Can I say that? [chuckles]

49
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,623
You don't have to be a dick about it.

Or is this pre-season?

-Analogy?

[Brett] You're welcome for that one.

66
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,046
Morning!

67
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,964
-[Jason] Hey, what's up, Doug?
-How are you doing?

68
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,216
Good to see you, man.

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,093
-Can we talk?
-Yeah, sure.

70
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,095
-Coffee?
-[Doug] Coffee would be great.

71
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,181
-And I'm kind of in a hurry, but--
-Yeah? We'll be fine.

72
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,308
So what's happening?

73
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,726
My house is not happening.

74
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,311
-Yeah, hasn't sold yet.
-[chuckles]

75
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,773
Are you coming here to tell me
you're ready to reduce the price?

76
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,983
Or get rid of my realtor.

77
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,777
-I'm kidding.
-[chuckles]

78
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,320
Um, we can talk about that.

79
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,488
[Jason]<i> </i>Doug is a great client.

80
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,075
We've done three or four deals,
and all of them have been significant.

81
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,703
So I'd say north of $20 million for sure.

82
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,914
And we've known him
and represented him for years.

83
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,125
He's certainly one 
of our most important clients.

84
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,460
You need your housekeeper
to dust these, uh...

85
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,087
-Do I?
-Yeah!

86
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,423
-This place gets cleaned like, every--
-It's terrible.

87
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,633
Okay.

88
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,592
Six months.

89
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,845
No offers, not even one.

90
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,763
[Jason]<i> </i>Well, we're also listed high.

91
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,724
[Doug]<i> </i>We're also in Trousdale Estates.

92
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,226
My blood's up to here right now. Sorry.

93
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,563
It's frustrating. The house has been on
longer than both of us anticipated.

94
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,815
But it doesn't have city views.

95
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,109
It's no fault of yours.
It just doesn't have city views.

96
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,903
And that's what people are paying
<i>that </i>type of money for

97
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,947
if you're trying to get
over $2,000 a square foot.

98
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,742
We also think 
the house should be listed...

99
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,118
under ten.

100
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,664
So, what's Christine doing?
How many showings has she had?

101
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,749
Do you know?

102
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,167
About a dozen.

103
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,212
Most of those occurred when we were 
closer to coming on the market.

104
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:18,133
Obviously, you're going to get a rush of
activity, you know, the first few weeks,

105
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,677
but a home that's valued 
at over $10 million

106
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,888
doesn't get a phone call every day.

107
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,849
If I reduce to nine-nine-five,
I want it sold.

108
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,435
I think with a new price
we're gonna get a lot of activity.

109
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,063
-Three months.
-I'll say that.

110
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,357
I would not be surprised if we could

111
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,443
not get an offer
within the first three months.

112
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,861
-Especially at that price.
-Good.

113
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,863
-All right, man. Done.
-Hey, how are you?

114
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,072
Your client Doug is upstairs.

115
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,032
Oh, Doug's here?

116
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:42,991
-Yep.
-Oh, okay.

117
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,284
-Head up there.
-Okay.

118
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,788
-Thanks, Doug.
-Thank you.

119
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,080
-Thanks so much.
-Yeah.

120
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,332
Hi, Doug.

121
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:55,837
When a client stops in unexpectedly,
usually it means that they're frustrated.

122
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,340
And it's not a good sign.

123
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,674
Good to see you.

124
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,968
I talked to Jason.
We're reducing the price.

125
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,679
-You've got three months.
-Okay. Thank you.

126
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,849
Why don't we go over
what Doug and I just talked about?

127
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,229
You guys should clean this stuff up here.

128
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,688
-See you later. Take care.
-See you.

129
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,067
Doug is going to reduce the price
to nine-nine-nine-five.

130
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,860
That's a significant reduction.

131
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,445
Hopefully, we can still salvage this.

132
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,448
Hopefully, we can still breathe
some life into this listing,

133
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,700
even though it's been 
on the market for so long.

134
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,454
And I think making sure that everyone
that already knows about that house

135
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,374
now knows that we just did
a $2 million reduction,

136
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,668
-that's almost a 20% reduction.
-Yeah.

137
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,128
It's gonna reflect on you
if we can't get him an offer.

138
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,256
Well, I'm on it.
I have tons of people I can call,

139
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,508
and I'll get started on it right now.
I'll prove to him

140
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,095
-that I was the right person to work with.
-That's all I wanna hear. Thank you.

155
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,683
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

156
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,810
-What are you looking at?
-Wedding stuff.

157
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,562
[Romain] Mm-hmm.

158
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,106
I've got them all organized. Dresses...

159
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,984
Uh... destinations,

160
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:41,943
themes...

161
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,361
All right, so...

162
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:48,033
If we want to go to Bali,
like where we could be right on the water.

163
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,117
[Romain] Mm-hmm.

164
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,119
-Yeah, that's nice.
-I know.

165
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,330
-Here we are.
-[both] Oh, thank you.

166
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,166
My pleasure.
I've got the almond chai tea latte.

167
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,836
And for you, sir,
I've got the whole milk latte.

168
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,546
-[Mary] Thanks.
-[Romain] Thank you.

169
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,174
So what do you think between places?

170
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,593
There's Bali. We could do something
a little bit closer.

171
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,555
-Whatever you prefer. I mean...
-So you don't care...

172
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,934
what... even what destination we go to?

173
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,394
Any of those places would be fine for me.

174
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,855
-It's more the one you're gonna choose.
-Okay.

175
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,192
All right, so, then...

176
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,279
this is what I was thinking.

177
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,822
I think this is so pretty.

178
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:28,949
I love this dress.

179
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,742
Do you like that?

180
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,955
-Yeah.
-You seem, like, bored by this.

181
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,708
No, I mean... It's more...
It's a girl thing.

182
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,920
-But it's your wedding!
-Yeah, but it's a girl thing.

183
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,673
You know, dress, flower... I mean...

184
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,344
I like it, but it's more something
you should, I mean, know.

185
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,890
I ain't gonna ask Jason or Brett
which flower I should get? You know?

186
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,310
Jason picks out
all the stuff in his house.

187
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,563
But it's a decoration for a house.

188
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,274
Yeah, decoration for...
And this is a decoration for our wedding.

189
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,903
Yeah, but it's girl stuff.
A wedding, babe.

190
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,989
I mean... You know what I mean?

191
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,116
I would like you to be interested.

192
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:16,121
I never say I wasn't.
I would prefer you to choose.

193
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:21,751
So, I'll just pick,
like, neon purple and blue

194
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,421
and stuff like that to go at the wedding. 
You're cool with that?

195
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,257
I mean, if that's what you want...

196
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,551
You're being annoying.

197
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,553
I'm not annoying, babe. I just--

198
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,973
But I get excited about it. You're not.

199
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,475
Yes, I am. 
I'm just saying that you should--

200
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,853
You're the one that asked me
to marry you, and--

201
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,439
It doesn't mean that I need
to plan the wedding.

202
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,358
Maybe until you're ready 
to help plan the wedding,

203
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,110
-maybe we shouldn't get married.
-Why?

204
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,280
Do you even want to still get married?

205
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,283
-Yes, I do!
-Or you just don't want to plan a wedding?

206
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,659
No, I just...

207
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,329
I just don't think it should be me
planning the wedding.

208
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,290
So you think it should just be me?

209
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,668
As busy as I am, you think I should
just add this onto my plate, too?

210
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,547
No, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying
it's a girl thing and then...

211
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:10,967
Fine.

212
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,486
Hi, this is Christine Quinn
at the Oppenheim Group.

213
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,613
So, listen, I'm calling in regards
to my property

214
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,532
that you actually viewed in Beverly Hills.

215
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,493
We just had a $2 million price reduction

216
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,662
and I wanted to see if you were interested
in getting back out there to see it.

217
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,165
[man]<i> Oh, well, thank you so much.</i>

218
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,251
<i>Unfortunately, it's still out of our price</i>
<i>range, even with the reduced price.</i>

219
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,338
All right. Thank you so much
for your time. I really appreciate it.

[groans]

221
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,468
[Maya] He said <i>no bueno?</i>

222
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,303
-It's still out of his price point.
-What?

223
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,639
I saw his financials,
I mean, he could afford it.

224
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,517
I just think 
that he was going through a job change,

225
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,394
-and I don't really think he felt stable.
-Okay.

226
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,731
Well, it's like my client can afford
Harold and he ended up leasing it.

227
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,776
And now I have to deal
with being a property manager.

228
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,197
Maya, I can see you being
a real Israeli slum lord.

229
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,281
[laughs]

230
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,534
[in Israeli accent]
You are late on your rent!

231
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,786
Exactly.

232
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,663
I would like to have her as a landlord.

233
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,542
You know, I feel like she'd probably yell
at me for my rent being late all the time,

234
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,837
but then she'd laugh and laugh 
and be like, "Want to grab margaritas?"

235
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,463
And I'd be like, "Yeah, let's go."

with the Oppenheim Group. How are you?

244
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,273
Listen, I'm calling because you viewed
my property in Beverly Hills

245
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,358
and we had a significant price reduction.

246

00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,946
about some clients
that you had interested in my...

248

I'm good, thank you. Listen, I'm calling

where if somebody closes escrow,

they can walk into this house,

You're mad at me?

-Hi, I'm Heather.
-Hi. Jeff.

273

-Nice to meet you.
-I was expecting Brandon.

274
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,723
I know. I'm so sorry. He couldn't make it.

275
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,477
He's working. He works for one of the
largest architecture firms in the world.

276
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,812
So he couldn't come out,
but he's coming next weekend.

277
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,276
Jeff and I have 
a very long-standing close relationship,

278
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,070
but it certainly doesn't
make me look good,

279
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,739
that I tell him there's a client
showing up and he doesn't show up.

280
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,659
Tell me about the, uh, client of yours.

281
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,620
One of my friends, 
it's his client and his investor.

282
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,247
Um, he lives in China.

283
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,375
And we are casually having dinner
and I brought up this home.

284
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,128
And he has a Chinese investor
that really wants to move to LA.

285
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,339
He wants this whole Hollywood lifestyle.

286
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,050
So I brought Brandon here
and he loves it.

287
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,096
And now the renderings, I think, 
are selling it even more, so I'm excited.

Heather knows how busy I am,
and she should understand

290
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,437
that anybody selling 
a 40-plus-million-dollar house

291
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,189
is probably busy as well.

that Brandon didn't make it

that you didn't tell me.

So I didn't look, you know, stupid 
when you just showed up by yourself.

305
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,308
Yeah, I was literally, like, 
on the phone with him.

306
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,102
"I need you here. I don't want
to cancel this meeting. It's huge."

307
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,229
I didn't want to cancel.

308
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,523
-I thought that would look worse.
-That would be worse.

309
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,567
Obviously, I mean, 
I'm glad that you showed up.

310
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,819
My concern is, one, him not showing up.

311
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,904
Two, I haven't met his client.

312
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,781
I haven't seen proof of funds.

313
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,867
I don't know that much about his client.

314
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,285
You know, I will try to get that.

315
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,370
Because I also want to know,
so I don't look stupid.

316
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,831
I just always like to be over-prepared.

317
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,084
I like to have the answer to every
question before I go into any situation.

318
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,211
I think working with you,
you've taught me that

319
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,298
-and I need to be better about that.
-I don't need you to just be prepared.

320
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,176
I need you to be overly prepared
all the time.

321
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,178
Okay.

322
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,098
This is a huge listing for him,
so he has to be careful. I get that.

323
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,185
But like I said to him, 
"You met Brandon. You trust Brandon."

324
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,896
I'm an asset to Oppenheim Group
and I think they need to realize that

325
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,357
'cause I could walk out this door any day

326
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,860
and I've been thinking that I might go
move and live with Nick in Sweden.

327
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,988
Is there anything else that I need to do
that I'm not doing then?

328
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,783
Just be overly prepared all the time.

329
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,743
Okay.

339

These pants are just...
I've never sat in them.

340
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,438
So I'm like, "Is this 
what it feels like to sit in couture?"

341
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,524
-I don't know. Jesus!
-[chuckles]

342
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,567
This was a mistake for a nail salon.

343
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,569
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

344
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,488
-[Christine] Thanks so much.
-Cheers.

345
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,782
Cheers, babe. Cheers!

346
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,868
-[Christine] How are you and Romain doing?
-We've been working so much.

347
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,205
Like, you know how it 
goes up and down a little bit sometimes.

348
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,165
Because we would work so much,
we only see each other,

349
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,709
-like, an hour or two at a time.
-Yeah.

350
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,545
So it kind of feels, at times,

351
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,132
like we are almost, 
like, living two separate lives.

352
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,593
We just need a little bit of time
so we can... [chuckles]

353
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,054
-...plan our future, you know?
-Yeah.

354
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,057
Right now, we are just
living in the present, I guess.

355
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,392
[Mary]<i> But I just think that...</i>

356
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,354
that Romain is getting cold feet, maybe.

357
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,691
I am kind of hesitant to tell Christine

358
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,818
because we've gotten into
arguments about this.

359
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,445
She thinks we're rushing.

360
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,238
Uh, she doesn't know if he's ready.

361
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,699
[Christine] I feel like it's really fast.

362
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,702
-And I just want to make sure--
-What, me and Romain?

363
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,370
You and Romain getting engaged.

364
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,623
I wish I could just be
open and honest with her

365
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,710
and not have to hear, 
you know, I told you so, but...

366
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,421
She would say it... for sure.

367
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,047
Is everything okay?

368
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,382
Like, with you in general?

369
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,219
It just seems seems like there's a bunch
of things that have been happening lately.

370
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,556
Yeah, I mean, everything's okay.
I just feel like...

371
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,683
everything's happening all at once,
you know?

372
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,601
Yeah.

373
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,520
It's, like, my last intention 
is to, like, let people down

374
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:23,483
or make them think that, you know,
I'm not capable of doing my job.

375
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,486
Honestly, I don't even know myself
what it is, but...

376
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,657
It kind of seems like
since the new girls have come, you just--

377
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,076
you haven't quite seemed yourself.

378
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,207
Maybe I have been off my game.
Yeah. I don't know.

379
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,210
Like, we were all doing so amazing before,
kicking ass and taking names.

380
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,464
And I just feel like they came and it 
just started, like, a whirlwind of drama.

381
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,842
-Right.
-And I've been focusing on that.

382
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:54,347
And it's been irritating. I just feel like
that's been kind of snowballing things.

383
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,684
Don't let the new girls, like, get to you.
I mean, you know who you are.

384
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,603
You're Christine.
Everyone's scared of you.

385
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,896
-Right!
-I mean, show them that.

386
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,732
-I know, I need to keep it that way.
-I know. Remind them!

387
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,609
-I know, you're right.

<i>He rents them, usually.</i>
<i>And he did an amazing job.</i>

417

Every new house that he does, he does
even a better job than the previous house.

418
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,139
But I don't think he can commit
to a house long term.

419
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,601
I think they can commit 
to only one thing: to the dogs.

-No, I just feel like it's a girl thing.

454
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,611
-[Maya chuckles]
-I mean...

455
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,072
But two people are getting married.
[chuckles]

456
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,950
A guy and a girl, right? 
So it is a girl thing.

457
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,452
-He's not helping much.
-You're just gonna show up, huh?

458
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,370
-Like...
-No.

459
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,706
Chrishell, did your husband help you
plan the wedding?

460
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,999
-Did he what?
-Help you plan the wedding.

461
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:09,959
He did.

462
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,087
I was surprised. There were things
I thought I was gonna just do.

463
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,756
[Mary] See? Talk to Justin.

464
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,175
[Chrishell] And he actually was like,
"What about this?"

465
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,677
And I was like, "Oh, okay."

466
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,889
-See? Tell him it's not just a girl thing.
-[Maya] You're in a tight spot, Romain.

467
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,850
[Jason] If I could gather everyone...

468
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,018
[Maya] Can you do it fast?
My nipples are getting hard.

469
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,687
Maya's nipples are getting hard,
I'll be quick.

470
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,938
[Maya] I'm getting cold.

471
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,066
All of us got a cute gift for Maya,
so I wanna give it to you.

472
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,609
-Oh, wow. Thank you, guys.
-[all] Aw.

473
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,028
-Little baby outfits!
-[Maya] Oh, my gosh.

474
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,155
[all] Aw!

475
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,407
-[Maya] This is so cute!
-[Heather] How cute!

476
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,868
-This is so cute.
-[Chrishell] That is so cute.

477
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,952
[Maya] My God. I love it.

478
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,830
The newest member.
It's never too early to start branding.

479
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,540
[Maya] Covers my boobs, so that's good.

480
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,376
Yeah, he's gonna be 
a good little door knocker. I can tell.

481
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,044
[Maya] I know, right?

482
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,546
She!

483
00:20:55,629 --> 00:21:00,050
I don't know.  Well, speaking of,
I have a little surprise for you, too.

484
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,470
-Twins?
-No, I wish, actually.

485
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,638
-No, you don't.
-I kind of do. Well, not...

486
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,098
Not if they are like you!

487
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,224
[Maya chuckles]

488
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,644
So I actually got a cake
for all of you guys.

489
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,606
And it's gonna be a sex--

490
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,691
-Gender reveal.
-Gender reveal.

491
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,818
-Ah!
-Not sex reveal.

492
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,446
We know you had sex, Maya.
We got it.

493
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,906
[all laugh]

494
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,450
-Go get the cake.
-[Jason] Bring the cake out.

495
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,912
I don't get it. How is it gonna say--

496
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,123
It's gonna be pink or blue frosting
on the inside of the cake.

497
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,792
-So if it's blue--
-Don't talk to me!

498
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,461
-Oh, my God!
-[Brett] If it's blue, it's a boy.

499
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,630
-And if it's pink, it's a girl.
-[Maya] You guys ready?

500
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,759
-[all cheer]
-[Brett] Ah, it's a boy!

501
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,886
[all] Yeah!

502
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,055
Whoo!

503
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,973
I like boys.

504
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,558
Nice, Maya!

505
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,685
Mwah!

506
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,854
[Maya]<i> Hopefully,</i>
<i>everything is good and healthy.</i>

507
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,816
<i>I'm looking forward to meet him.</i>

508
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,442
I'm happy. I'm very excited.

509
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,568
I'm thrilled, actually.

510
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,653
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

511
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,572
-I haven't talked to you all day.
-I know. I haven't talked to you either.

512
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,658
What's going on?

513
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,494
Oh, not much, just excited
for Maya and her baby.

514
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,664
-I know.
-We'll see how that works out.

515
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,668
Um... So, you know, some of the girls 
were saying they felt, like,

516
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,755
kind of a little bit of tension
in the office between us. I don't know.

517
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,590
Do you feel like there is tension?

518
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,718
I'm not going to lie. Yes.

519
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,722
-I do feel like there's a little tension.
-Yeah.

520
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:32,017
Um, I mean, my assumption is
that you just don't like me.

521
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,270
-[chuckles] I don't know.
-Not true. I don't know you.

522
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,022
So, how could I just not like you?
But I feel like,

523
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:41,277
at the same time, of what I've seen
makes me a little, like, resistant

524
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,322
to trust you, because when you first
joined us and Mary came to the office

525
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,033
and she had the whole, you know,
that dinner with Romain

526
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,202
where they talked about
their future and stuff,

527
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,996
she was crying, you know.

528
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,623
You were so empathetic to her,
which I thought was really sweet.

529
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,001
But then you kind of questioned
their relationship

530
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,421
when you and I were talking.
I felt like you were, though, you know?

531
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,090
You see, that's where
everything's coming from,

532
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,301
because I think 
that's so weird that you say that.

533
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,679
We were having a conversation,
a private conversation.

534
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,723
-Yeah.
-And I was asking you questions.

535
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,933
And then you turned it around to Mary

536
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,311
and made it sound like
I was talking bad about her.

537
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,606
And just now you said that I was
and I wasn't. I was asking questions

538
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,108
in a private situation
'cause I didn't know.

539
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,067
-Mm-hmm.
-So...

540
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:26,405
I was thinking it was a cool vibe
to, like, ask you privately.

541
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:30,284
But I also feel like the way you asked
was not necessarily neutral.

542
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,453
It was kind of like you had
an opinion about it.

543
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,622
-Okay.
-You were saying she should get a prenup.

544
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,540
I think everybody should get a prenup.

545
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:40,127
I didn't know that, and you don't know me
either, so it's kind of, like, you know,

546
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,795
lost in translation, maybe. I don't know.

547
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,882
But it seemed 
like it wasn't a neutral opinion.

548
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,176
-It seemed like it was opinionated.
-Right.

549
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,553
I don't like two-faced people,

550
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:53,015
and I'm not saying you <i>are </i>two-faced,
but it's going that direction

551
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,434
and I was like, "Oh, wow,
you were super nice to her,"

552
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,271
but then you didn't actually tell it,
like, you were <i>very </i>supportive to her.

553
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:02,274
So I was like, "Oh, wow."
Like, at least I'm direct, you know?

554
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,319
Wow! That was a lot. Okay.

555
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,113
Again, at least I'm honest, you know?

556
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,575
I'd rather that than have to guess,
like, where you stand.

557
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:16,372
Okay, so you think that I'm two-faced?

558
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,457
I didn't say that.

559
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,627
I said I didn't... I'm not saying you are,
but it's going in that direction.

560
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,005
Okay. Well, I will leave it at that.

561
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,508
I don't feel like anything
I have to say past this point

562
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,593
-you're gonna change your opinion.
-That's not true.

563
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,679
It's very clear
that this is going the wrong way.

564
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,099
All right. Well, I'm sorry
that you feel that way and, um...

565
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,685
-What can we do, you know?
-[chuckles]

566
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,812
What can we do? Okay.

567
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,272
It's almost impossible
to be friends with Davina.

568
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:45,109
At this point, my hands are...
I just give up.

569
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,028
And I see who she is
and I'm just going to do what I can

570
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:51,740
to work with her in a cordial way.

571
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,702
But I now know that there's no mistaking.

572
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:55,869
We're not friends.

573
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,204
What's going on?

574
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,873
We just had a little conversation
about the vibe in the office.

575
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,083
Where's my purse?

576
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,459
[Christina] What's going on?

577
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,962
-The weird vibe between you guys?
-Um, I mean...

578
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,880
Yeah, a little bit. Something like that.

579
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,758
-Is my purse by you, Heather?
-Uh... Yes.

580
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,510
Are you leaving?

581
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,053
-Yeah, I'm gonna go.
-You are?

582
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,013
Yeah.

583
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,682
[Davina] Unnecessarily dramatic.

584
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,977
I'm just gonna go inside for one second.
See you guys in a second.

585
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,979
[Davina] I know, so dramatic!

586
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,398
I just feel like 
there was a weird vibe in the office...

587
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,733
'Cause Chrishell is fake?

588
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,819
I mean... [chuckles] Kind of, you know?

589
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,070
-What do you mean?
-Yeah!

590
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:33,365
I told her. I basically said she's going
down the path of being two-faced.

591
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,034
-I agree.
-It makes me not trust her.

592
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,704
It's like you say things
and then you don't own up to them.

593
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,039
Like, the dinner that we had,

594
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,708
when I asked Chrishell what she said
and she wouldn't own up to it.

595
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,210
"You were that blacked out
you don't remember what you said?"

596
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,379
I'm not the only person that sees it.
Know what I mean?

597
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,630
Come on, no. Honestly.

598
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,631
What happened?

599
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,510
I don't know, just... 
Agh, I'm stressed out.

600
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:57,014
Davina just, like, went in on me.

601
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,601
Honestly, I'm still so, like, thrown off
by what just happened

602
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,436
that it takes me a second to even, like--

603
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,606
-I figured you guys had, like, tension--
-Now she's talking about me to everyone.

604
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,610
Now, like, everyone's gonna hate me.
I didn't even do anything.

605
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,071
She was very surprised that I called her

606
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,990
that she was going down
the two-faced kind of road.

607
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,743
Yeah, I told her. I was like, 
"Davina's... straightforward,"

608
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,286
and that's what I told her.

609
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,706
At the end, she kind of, like,
called me two-faced

610
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,875
and I said that... I'm like, "What?"

611
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,877
And she says,
"I'm not saying you're two-faced.

612
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,878
It's going that way."

613
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,755
"I'm not saying you're two-faced,
but you're two-faced?"

614
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,840
She said,
"I'm saying it's going that way."

615
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,176
So I just kind of like...

616
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,928
Davina is very direct.

617
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,680
I just felt like I couldn't keep going
back and forth with her,

618
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,015
so I just, like, left.

619
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,017
Now she's over there talking about me.

620
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,685
Can you come with me over there?

621
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,896
-I feel like I wanna defend myself.
-I'll come with you.

622
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,981
I don't want her talking about me
to everyone.

623
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,442
Why don't you just put it already to rest?

624
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,195
-Like, it's been--
-Yeah, it's so annoying.

625
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,073
Yeah, it was interesting. So I was like,
at least I am more direct, you know?

626
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,033
They're coming.

627
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,785
No, I totally agree.

628
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,162
-Hi, ladies.
-[all] Hi.

629
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,081
Hi, guys.

630
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,415
-Okay, guys.
-What's wrong?

631
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,458
-Davina.
-Yes?

632
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,044
The tension.
What's going on with the tension?

633
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:13,090
In an open setting, this is super awkward,
I'm just gonna say.

634
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:17,594
Mary and Romain, I never want
anything but the best for you guys,

635
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:22,391
and this is dating back a long time ago
where I was basically just asking

636
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,851
because everyone was so concerned

637
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,602
and I don't know the dynamics.

638
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:30,482
I was asking... I was, like,
in a private scenario with Davina,

639
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:35,154
I was asking her questions so that I could
know where the concerns were coming from.

640
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,156
I never expected that to come back to you

641
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,450
in a way where it was like I was talking
about you. I was asking questions.

642
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,369
-[Mary] Right.
-And so...

643
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,913
Apparently, you thought
that was me being two-faced.

644
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:48,000
Which is what I assumed,
because you didn't know,

645
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,086
and I would think 
that people could have questions.

646
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,838
[Chrishell]
I wasn't trying to be two-faced.

647
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,798
I was asking questions
in a private setting.

648
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,467
I know you said
"I'm not calling you that."

649
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,762
I didn't feel like
they were neutral questions

650
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,849
I feel like they had, like, an opinion.
They were coming from an opinion.

651
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,560
Does Romain pay
for his own share of stuff, do you think?

652
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,229
-Not much, I think.
-So she pays for everything?

653
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,191
Yeah, I mean...
I don't know him super well.

654
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,775
-I heard he's a baker.
-Yeah.

655
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,028
She's going to do a prenup, right?

656
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,322
Right, but I don't know them,
so I don't have an opinion.

657
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,074
I was asking questions
so that I could form one.

658
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,951
I understand where you're coming from

659
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,037
because she's asked questions.
Even at our dinner,

660
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,581
you asked about Jason and Mary
and that dynamic.

661
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,083
And you don't know anyone
like we all know each other.

662
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,753
You know, it's like a family.
She's new to the family.

663
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:38,342
I'm totally open to, like, letting it go,
and talking to you guys about it,

664
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,636
-but I still feel--
-Done. What about you, Chrishell?

665
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,972
I still feel like that's my real opinion,
you know?

666
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,601
I'm dying to drop it. 
I don't want this, but I don't...

667
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:52,981
Like, I feel like the talk we just had
privately escalated the whole situation,

668
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,192
'cause then it went to name calling, so...

669
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,070
-It really, like, made things worse...
-I don't know about name calling.

670
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,240
-Yeah, you called me two-faced.
-No, I said it's going down that path.

671
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,658
And it's a question mark.

672
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,036
Chrishell doesn't have a bad bone
in her body. And neither do you.

673
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,747
I don't really know what's going on,
but you guys need to hug it out.

674
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,207
Hold on.

675
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,459
Because all I know 
is we were at the happy hour

676
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,087
and I asked what the situation was about.

677
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:19,341
And I asked you, 
you said, "I don't remember."

678
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,551
I said, "What did you guys talk about?
I'm so confused."

679
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,263
You said, "I don't know. I made
some comments about Mary and Romain."

680
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,265
-People are talking.
-I swear to God.

681
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,641
I don't remember.

682
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:32,062
And you act like you didn't remember
what you talked about.

683
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:37,901
but then Davina told me in private
that you made some comments about Romain,

684
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:41,363
and I was like, "Oh, shit.That's so
interesting that all of a sudden,

685
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,073
you know, that came out."

686
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,534
So I feel like you don't own up
to the things that you say

687
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,077
and that's where this is coming from.

688
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,413
Christine, when I had spoken to you,

689
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:55,585
I was literally racking my brain of, 
like, what is she bringing up

690
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:56,712
that I don't even remember?

691
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,338
I always remember what I say.

692
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:02,259
I'm like, 
"Listen. I said this. I'm sorry." Like...

693
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,345
If I can-- Since we're all talking
about me right now,

694
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,806
sometimes people 
are just saying things, doing things.

695
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,852
Your intentions are what matters.

696
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,022
Okay, Mary, if you're questioning that,
I get that--

697
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,649
[Mary] If you're asking questions,
it's your intention.

698
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,819
Own up to what you say. Do you have...
dementia? I don't know.

699
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,488
Own up to what you say.
That's where I'm coming from.

700
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,366
Christine, I think 
you're being rough a little bit.

701
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,953
You look like you need
a little hug right now.

702
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,291
I don't... I think that you did...

703
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,378
Like, I don't think that you had
any bad intentions.

704
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,506
The next time I get in a fight with you,
I'll just not remember what happened.

705
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,467
-How about that?
-[Brett] Fine. I'll hug you.

706
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,094
I'll be like, "I don't remember,
I'm not responsible.

707
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,763
Everyone's gonna give me a... hug."

708
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,181
-Ridiculous.
-[Mary] Talk to me.

709
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,766
[Christine] Ridiculous. Please.

710
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,684
-[Brett] Davina.
-I was just asking questions.

711
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,144
Guys, come on.

712
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,937
I have no problem with Chrishell.

713
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,064
-Okay.
-[Brett] Just saying.

714
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,231
All right. Okay, good.

715
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,567
-You did two seconds ago.
-[Christine] You guys are ridiculous.

716
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,069
I wanna drop it if you want to drop it.

717
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,820
[Christine] 
Pretend we don't remember things we say?

718
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,072
-[Davina] She's crying?
-I know.

719
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,324
-You know I love you.
-Are you making fun of me?

720
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,409
No, I'm not making fun of you.
I'm just saying it's--

721
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,286
[Christine] This is ridiculous. Come on!

722
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,538
-Christine--
-[Brett] Guys, tone this down.

723
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,874
-[Christine] I'm not trying to be mean.
-[Mary] This is intense.

724
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,252
I'm sorry. I'm not a kiss ass.
I'm not a pushover.

725
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,380
-I'm not fake. I'm just not.
-[Davina] This is crazy.

726
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,173
[Christine] Only my tits are fake.
I'm not.

727
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,008
-[Christine] Sorry.
-I don't...

728
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,637
I'm trying... I don't want to talk to her.
I don't want to cry.

729
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,473
-You're so mean!
-No, I'm not mean.

730
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,477
That bitch is a... liar.
Own up to what you say.

731
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,145
Honestly, it's bullshit.

732
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:43,402
I'm good friends with her,
but I don't stand for that shit.

733
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,114
-It's just too much.
-[Brett] Honey.

734
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,283
-Don't take it that seriously.
-No, stay.

735
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,451
-Seriously.
-[Maya] Chrishell?

736
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,204
-[Brett] Don't take it seriously.
-[Chrishell] I don't want them to think--

737
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,165
-[Maya] Are you okay?
-[Chrishell] It's too much.

738
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,584
-[Brett] It was way too much.
-[Chrishell] It was traumatic.

739
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,004
-Honestly. Like, how pathetic is she?
-Unnecessarily dramatic.

740
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,631
So pathetic.

741
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,759
[Maya] Chrishell, come here for a sec.

742
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,553
I don't want you to be hurt by Christine.

743
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,929
Christine was a bit rough.

744
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,472
Crazy night.

745
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,099
Wow!

746
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:19,771
At the end of the day, I feel like
at that dinner, you conveniently--

747
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,481
[Brett] This isn't about making points.

748
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,776
-Can you stop? I'm... trying to--
-I know, but you made your point.

749
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,530
-Trust me.
-Can I reiterate and you get off my back?

750
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,323
I always own up to my stuff.

751
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:33,952
If, in the moment, I didn't know exactly
what she was talking about,

752
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,787
now I've already talked to Mary.

753
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:39,040
I've told her everything I said.
I own up to everything I've said.

754
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,043
I understand that, but we came back
from the bathroom, Maya and I,

755
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,671
and we had asked you
what you guys were talking about.

756
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:48,008
You said "I don't remember. I just said
stuff about Mary and Romain."

757
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,093
Christine, I'm not having
this conversation with you.

758
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,596
-Because you know that I'm right.
-Christine, here's the thing.

759
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,556
You said you don't remember.

760
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,143
-It makes you sound like you're two-faced.
-Also, I don't have to tell you

761
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,313
-what I said if I don't feel...
-Also, it makes you sound two-faced

762
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,940
when you don't own up
to the shit that you say.

763
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,817
Do you understand where I'm coming from?

764
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,612
-When I ask you what did you say--
-Don't yell at me.

765
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,530
-When I ask you...
-Don't yell at me.

766
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:13,325
-Hold on. Take it down.
-...what did you say, and you don't own up

767
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,077
to what you said, 
it makes you look like a crazy person.

768
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,580
If you keep yelling at me,
I'm not gonna listen to you.

769
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,916
I always own up to what I say.

770
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,460
I said, "I said this. So what?
I said this. I'll back it up."

771
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,087
Christine, I've talked to Mary
about what I said.

772
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:30,634
But when I asked <i>you </i>at the dinner,
you conveniently didn't remember.

773
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,845
You understand the difference, right?
Or do you still have dementia?

774
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,681
Christine.

775
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,767
-Leave everything behind.
-I mean, come on.

776
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,393
Yeah, no rebuttal because I'm right.

777
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,940
Christine, this is enough.

778
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,193
-I mean, seriously?
-I'm leaving. Don't do this again to me.

[Christine] Yeah! She's so... shady.

784
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,706
I was protecting you as my best friend.

785

-It looks so good! Oh, my God!
-So good.

805
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,867
This is so great.

806
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,702
Thank you for such a great year.

807
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,747
You guys certainly earned this.

808
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,542
I think it's cool to see yourself
in Sunset Plaza. It's the main strip.

809
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:31,212
And you see all these big billboards
for, like, big TV shows

810
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,257
and all that stuff, 
and all of a sudden, us up there.

811
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:39,596
I appreciate that he chose to spend
his money not just on book collections,

812
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,390
but also on, like, a billboard for us.

813
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,142
Look at us, guys.

814
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,644
-We made it!
-[Brett] You made it!

815
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,479
Wait, where is Chrishell?

816
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,064
Yeah, where is Chrishell?

817
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,399
I don't know.
Hopefully, she'll show up. Yeah.

818
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,277
Well, has anyone talked to her today?
No?

819
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,071
Did you get a chance
to talk to her after...

820
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,697
No, I mean, she blocked me.

821
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,075
I tried to apologize after the party
and she blocked me.

822
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,827
And then blocked me on Instagram.
So I had no way of apologizing.

823
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,287
-All right.
-At the end of the day,

824
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,791
I tried to call her because 
I did want to apologize for my delivery.

825
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,418
And I know that I was drinking
and things were heated.

826
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,087
I think she was blindsided by it.

827
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,173
She's not used to you
or the family environment so much.

828
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,299
-I think so, too.
-Yeah.

829
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,718
But in fairness,
I'm newer to the group, too, you know,

830
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,262
and I'm a little more direct as well,

831
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,891
and so I had a similar conversation with
her, but it was just more calm, you know.

832
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,103
-'Cause you're mature.
-I wasn't, you know, so drunk, either.

833
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,153
-[Jason] There she is.
-Hi.

834
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,072
Hi, guys.

835
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,242
Hi, how are you?
We were wondering where you were.

836
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,619
-I'm here.
-Wait. Did you see this?

837
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,038
I couldn't miss such a big moment.
Oh, my gosh!

838
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,541
Congratulations! That's so cool.

839
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,335
That's amazing. Congrats, everybody.

840
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,838
That looks so good.
Everyone looks awesome.

841
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,880
Thank you.

842
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,173
-Hi.
-Hi.

843
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,843
I'd love to give you a hug,
but you don't have to.

844
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,553
Hi, how are you?

845
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,221
[Christine] I'd love to give you a hug.

846
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,436
And, you know, just to let you know,
I did try to call you after.

847
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,938
Chrishell, I'm talking to you.

848
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:16,151
I did try to call you after
and apologize about my delivery.

849
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,777
I know it was extremely strong.

850
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,655
-I tried to apologize.
-I have nothing to speak to you about.

851
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,408
This is about me genuinely apologizing.

852
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,243
-Thank you.
-As I tried to do when it happened,

853
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,662
-but you blocked me.
-I didn't block you.

854
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:33,168
I've been through a lot in my life
and I think it would take a lot more

855
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,629
than Christine to bully me
out of a good situation

856
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,173
that I worked really hard to get to.

857
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,800
This is a great moment.
We're celebrating a good time.

858
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,219
[Jason] Listen. 
Let's remember we're here to--

859
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,305
