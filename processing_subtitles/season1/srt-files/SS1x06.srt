[Jason] <i>Ladies.</i>

We're going to start the photography.

[Mary] Let's do it.

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,396
Chrishell and Christine on this chair.

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,107
Let's go red, black, red, black
on the couch.

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,442
-So, Heather...
-Okay.

10
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,819
Jason likes to do those photos
for the company,

11
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,572
so they're gonna feature 
in magazines, flyers, website,

12
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,116
maybe even a poster in his bedroom.
Who knows?

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,743
Actually, why don't-- Yes, stand.

14
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,329
Your shoes will be in the picture,
but kind of sitting right there.

15
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,415
-So we sit?
-Yeah, this is actually pretty good.

16
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,042
Our marketing shots are gonna be epic.

17
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,586
-[Jason] Or Maya and Heather, to switch.
-Yeah, exactly.

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,130
Maybe, just, when you're holding 
the jacket, don't have your elbow up here.

19
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,049
-Have it come down.
-Okay.

20
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,511
And then it goes brunette, blonde,
brunette, too. Why don't you two switch?

21
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,013
-You have the Zoolander look right now.
-[Mary laughs]

22
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,265
I'm practicing.

23
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:01,478
Some girls definitely take it
more seriously than others.

24
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,980
I'm not gonna say names.

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,398
<i>But...</i>

26
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,649
Christine. [chuckles]

27
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,901
Let's do some gangster ones
and some smiles.

28
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,152
Yup. Let's do gangster first.

29
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,571
You guys ready for gangster?

30
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,197
[Davina] All right, guys, look alive.

31
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,909
Do I look like a fat girl in a club dress,
like, sitting like this?

32
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,869
-What?!
-Like on a Saturday night?

33
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,122
[Michael] Good.

34
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,665
One, two, three.

35
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,250
Power pose. No smiling.

36
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,167
[Jason] No smiling.

37
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,003
Nice, loving it.

38
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,880
Good. Here we go.

39
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,175
-You guys all on the same page?
-Seriously, I'm sitting on an inch.

40
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,095
Seriously, my whole ass is numb.

41
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,430
[Brett] Just rub it out for a second.

42
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,639
[Mary laughs]

43
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,725
Good job, guys. Nice meeting everyone.

44
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,059
[Brett] Good, looking good.

45
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,603
Nice. Good job, good job.

46
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:43,812
[Maya] Do we have it or...

47
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,607
If you guys are looking at the monitor,
do you only look at yourselves

48
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,817
-or are you looking at everyone else, too?
-Myself.

49
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,110
[Jason] So many are good.

50
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,196
We're gonna drive each other nuts
if we look at this. There's no--

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,908
-We already drive each other nuts.
-But even more. This is good.

58
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,469
Latte.

59
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,305
I like that you just said a law-tte.

60
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,807
-[laughs]
-If it's like a law-tte.

61
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,727
[Chrishell] Okay, Mary, I'm gonna take you
back home with me, girl.

62
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,646
If you got a law-tte.

63
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,359
Shoot, doggone, that's a law-tte.

Oh, my God.

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,238

at some point, didn't we?

66
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,574
-Oh, I did for sure.
-Yeah.

67
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,868
[Chrishell]
I still have it if I have a few drinks.

68
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,204
[Christine] 
Yeah, no, I do, too. Mine comes out, too.

69
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,582
So I had a date with Jacob
over the weekend.

70
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,584
-Oh, you did?
-Oh, how did it go?

71
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,087
The chemistry physically wasn't there,

72
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,631
and it's just going to be
on a professional level.

73
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,758
-We're just going to be friends.
-Uh.

74
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,593
-Well, at least you know.
-Yeah.

75
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,636
Yeah.

76
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,014
-On to the next?
-On to the next. Right.

77
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,767
-[Chrishell] Hey, boys.
-[Christine] Hey, guys.

78
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,895
Hey, hun. I actually need to speak
with both of you briefly.

79
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,481
[Christine] Okay. Are we in trouble? Okay.

80
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,316
-Actually, good news.
-[Chrishell] Yeah?

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,194
I received a call from one 
of the founders of Wag,

82
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,488
-you know, the dog-walking app.
-[Christine] Okay.

83
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,241
And you had met with her recently
at an open house.

84
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,118
-Her name's Alexandra.
-[Chrishell] Yeah. Yes, yes.

85
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,705
And you had actually represented
a colleague of hers in the past.

86
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,833
I think it was maybe a couple years ago. 
So she actually wants to meet

87
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,710
or speak with both of you.

88
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,294
Okay.

89
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,923
Like, a co-listing?

90
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,717
[Brett] I don't know 
how it's going to work out.

91
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,969
To be honest, it's up to you guys.

92
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,679
This is her contact.

93
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,806
So she wants to meet with us
together or separate?

94
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,101
[Brett] I don't even know. I know 
she wants to meet with both of you.

95
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,396
My priority is that she gets
the representation she wants.

96
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,649
Whatever works for her works for us.

97
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,943
All right. Real estate <i>Hunger Games.</i>
All right.

98
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,321
Someone who knows the Strip 
would be the best for this client,

99
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,908
considering, you know, 
Sunset Strip is my area of expertise.

100
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,410
<i>Maybe she wants a charity case.</i>

101
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,037
Maybe she wants to help a stray dog.
I don't know.

102
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,289
-Okay, thanks.
-Perfect, okay.

111
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,577
so obviously it's super important for me
to make sure everything goes perfect,

112
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,996

didn't go as planned

-This is Kangaroo.

119
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,895
Kangaroo, how cute. Hi, baby.

120
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,815
[man] This is a cute little guest room.

121
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:15,941
[woman] Yeah.

122
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,401
[Heather] Um, the home was built in 1938.

123
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,529
-It was just newly renovated.
-[woman] Nice.

124
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,739
[Heather] Yeah, they put in 
a little over two million.

125
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,700
Wow, look at this view!

126
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,828
-[man] Peter would love this.
-Hey, guys.

127
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,955
I just wanted to make sure
everything was going okay.

128
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,122
-Yeah.
-Do you like it?

129
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,040
-Yeah.
-Awesome.

130
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,501
-I'm looking to expand. 
-Okay.

131
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,380
Uh, my wardrobe is getting too big
and my boyfriend's getting fatter,

132
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,714
-so we need more room.
-Oh, he is? [laughs]

133
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,093
So, uh, he needs a trainer
and you need a bigger closet. Got that.

134
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,720
We have a special spot
for Kangaroo right here.

135
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,973
-[woman] Aw, so sweet. Kangy, look!
-[Heather] Yeah.

136
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,766
Yes. I want to give you a brochure.

137
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,436
Um, are there any schools in the area?
'Cause I'm thinking of having a baby soon.

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,647
-You are? Exciting!
-Yeah.

139
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,732
Yeah, there are great schools in the area.

140
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,651
I love that you're gonna have a baby soon.

141
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,570
I know! I'm not pregnant yet.

142
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,989
Yeah, but, you know,
you're thinking about it.

143
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,991
-Amazing, thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

144
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,201
Bye, Kangaroo. So cute.

145
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,546
[Christine] Holly Drive is so cute.

146
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,756
[Jason] And so well priced.
I don't know what's going on.

147
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,676
She's looking, ideally,
south of Wilshire, but...

148
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,469
South of Wilshire, ideally? Oh.

149
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,054
[Jason] Mary, totally off-topic,

150
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,683
I'm looking at buying
a Picasso ceramic vase.

151
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,059
Do you mind taking a look at it?

152
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,895
I'm going to put it in my kitchen.

153
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,857
[Mary] Hey, Christine, do you want to buy
a Picasso vase for 35 grand, too?

154
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,776
That's it? That's a steal. Sign me up.

155
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,487
-Can you come look at it before I get it?
-We should all get one.

156
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,865
It's 12 inches by six and a half inches.

157
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,492
-It's cool, though. I really like it.
-I have the perfect spot for it.

158
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,703
Oh, originally 40 grand, now only--

159
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,788
-It's a steal, man.
-Yeah.

160
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,541
I mean, where did you find that?

161
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,792
[Jason] Uh, Belgium.

162
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,837
-I love their waffles and the--
-[Mary laughs]

163
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,339
Yeah, I'm pretty excited.

164
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,842
[Jason] Why don't we get 
the team meeting started right now?

165
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:06,968
[Davina] Okay.

166
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,056
Come here, sweetheart.
Come see Papa. Come see Papa!

167
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:11,973
-Okay.
-[Jason] Okay.

168
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,141
Uh, Christine, what's up with you?

169
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,435
Um, I had a really interesting showing
the other day.

170
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,564
For the first time, I had someone walk out
without completing the tour.

171
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,442
I showed it to them and they loved it.
They thought it was beautiful--

172
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,527
And then you turn around, 
you're like, "Wait, where are you guys?"

173
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,614
I was like, " Great! Let's go
to the other side of the house now."

174
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,865
And they're like, "We're good, thanks."

175
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,118
If it makes you feel better, I've had,
often times with celebrities,

176
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,204
I've had them pull up, take off,

177
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,748
and their manager calls me five minutes 
later and says, "You know what?

178
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,667
They don't need to see it.
They don't like the outside."

179
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,836
[Maya] Yeah, it's so rude.
Like, it's so disrespectful for the time.

180
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,965
Unfortunately, honestly, in this business,
people waste your time all the time.

181
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,549
Um... Mary, what's going on?

182
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,094
-I just closed, uh, two escrows...
-[Heather] Whoo! Yay.

183
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,931
...and then another one this month 
as well. So, yeah, that's three.

184
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:57,060
Oh, speaking of which, I'm gonna be
bringing you on a listing that I've got,

185
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,354
about three point six million, because 
you have closed so many deals lately.

186
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,189
Oh, that's awesome. Thank you.

187
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,984
-You got it. You deserved it.
-Very cool. I appreciate that.

188
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,444
-Good job.
-I do not think there's any favoritism.

189
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,990
He rewards who kicks ass and sells homes.

190
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,243
[Maya] 
<i>There are three favorites in the office. </i>

191
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,329
Mary, Mary, and also Mary.

192
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,998
<i>Then you have Nico and Zelda.</i>

193
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,042
So yeah. So we are probably
behind Mary, Nico, and Zelda.

194
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,337
All right, so I know 
you all are working very hard,

195
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,173
but we do need to start closing
some more deals. Okay?

196
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,760
Speaking of closing deals, Heather,
I took this agent Kelsey and her client

197
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,595
over to your Sunset Plaza listing,
they loved it.

198
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,931
-Awesome. It's ready to go.
-That house is looking good.

199
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,184
It would mean everything to me
if he found a buyer for this house

200
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,894
<i>and helped me close this deal.</i>

201
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,147
-Let's get back to work, everyone.
-[all] All right.

202
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,690
Come on, sweetheart, jump.

203
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,816
[Heather] Oh. Ooh.

204
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,986
<i>♪ Well, I'm doing ♪ </i>

205
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,280
<i>♪ I know I'm not losing ♪ </i>

206
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,283
<i>♪ There ain't no confusion... ♪ </i>

207
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,746
Do I look like a crack whore today?
'Cause I feel one.

208
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,584
Sometimes I'm like, "Yeah, I'm such
a supermodel today." And I'm like

209
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,211
"Who's that Lindsay Lohan
drug addict in my mirror?

210
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,630
I'm like... I hate when that happens.

211
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,550
[Chrishell] 
Um, I'm a little nervous. I've never--

212
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,428
I've had this with like, you know,
when someone's listing their house

213
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,929
where they want 
to meet several different agents,

214
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,848
-but I've never had it with a buyer.
-[Christine] And not at the same time.

215
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,224
I know, it's very strange.

216
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,060
So I don't really know what to expect.

217
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,145
It's like we've been given a mission.

218
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,146
Thanks, Charlie.

219
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,731
I love a good mission.

220
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,109
Hi!

221
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:32,489
So a lot of times in Los Angeles,
you're talking to people's people.

222
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,076
<i>I heard that Alexandra is representing</i>
<i>the owners of Wag,</i>

223
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,120
<i>and, um, she's delegated</i>
<i>to look at houses for them, so</i>

224
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,915
hopefully we can find them
the right house.

225
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,959
-How are you today?
-Good, how are you?

226
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,920
-Great.
-So, this is weird,

227
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,340
but do people ever tell you that you look
like LC from <i>Laguna Beach?</i>

228
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,342
-Yes.
-Totally. Yes.

229
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,679
So we're excited to see you today.
I know obviously I met you before.

230
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:01,017
And I was curious how you heard about me,
because I think we have a mutual friend?

231
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:05,063
We do. So one of my colleagues, Eva,
she had mentioned you.

232
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,984
-Oh, my gosh, I love Eva. Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah, so I definitely was like,

233
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,071
have to meet 
and learn more about you

234
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,199
and kind of see what you see as my vision.

235
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,575
Please tell her I said hello.

236
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,660
I will, definitely.

237
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,703
So I remember you mentioned a little bit,

238
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,207
but I was telling Christine, I couldn't
remember exactly. What is it that you do?

239
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,086
So I'm one of the founding team members
of Wag, the dog walking app.

240
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,754
-That's it. Yeah.
-[Christine] I love that company.

241
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,256
So, I used to have a doberman,

242
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,633
-so I would hire you guys. Yeah.
-That's great.

243
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,343
I'm glad to hear of a user.

244
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,971
[Christine] Yeah, yeah. So, no,
I know all about you guys.

245
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,057
So, really I wanted to meet with both
of you to kind of give you an idea

246
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,559
of what he's looking for.

247
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,437
Do you have any idea of what neighborhood,
square footage, price point?

248
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,065
So, preferably, uh, Hollywood.

249
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,776
A big factor for him would be
finding a place

250
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,820
-that's in walking distance of work.
-Convenience.

251
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,990
Dog friendly, uh, place.
You want a yard? Okay. Got it.

252
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,575
Other than walking distance,

253
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,620
the price point we decided is
between four point two to four point six.

254
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:03,538
Okay.

255
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,708
Um, seeing a range of places
in that price point would be great.

256
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,587
And then, three to four bedrooms,
three to four bathrooms.

257
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,713
-Three to four.
-Okay.

258
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,591
We do plan on just going with one person.

259
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,638
I feel that gives me more
of that opportunity to bond

260
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:24,058
and get that vision and have
the experience we would like.

261
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,561
So, as far as working styles,

262
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,106
how would you both say
you work with your clients?

263
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,901
-Do you want to go first?
-Um, well, basically,

264
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,196
I'm very hands on, so what I'll do is I'll
get a feel for what you're looking for.

265
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,198
I'll map it out. I'll write it down.

266
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,242
I'll do my research on making sure
that I can find you

267
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,952
not only what you're looking for, 
but something

268
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,623
that's maybe not necessarily
out there on the MLS available to people.

269
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,834
And I'll do my best to negotiate,

270
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,086
get you a great deal,
stay within your price point,

271
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,881
and, um, make sure that you're happy.

272
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,299
-Awesome.
-You know? Yeah.

273
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,510
So just to add onto what she said,
because it was basically a perfect answer,

274
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,888
for me personally, I would just say--

275
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,266
I'm from the South, 
so I'm very, like, one-on-one.

276
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,603
And I would just say,
I just bought a house last year

277
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,188
and it was very stressful,

278
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,150
so I would think my job is
to let you enjoy the process

279
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,861
and let me take the stress on, 
'cause I think that's important.

280
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,988
I would just try and make sure 
every step of the way

281
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,823
that it would be an enjoyable process.

282
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:25,703
So you, um, haven't been working
with the Oppenheim Group as long, correct?

283
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:30,208
I haven't. I've actually been there
probably about, I'd say, four months now.

284
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,710
Okay. And how long have you been
with Oppenheim?

285
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:36,464
I've been at the company for,
like, almost four years.

286
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,132
-I've known Jason for a little while.
-[Alexandra] Oh, wow. Yeah.

287
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,511
Both of you are awesome,
and we really do look forward

288
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,054
to working with one of you,

289
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,808
so over the next day or two I definitely
will make that decision

290
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,477
and then we can go to the next step.

291
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,313
Christine and I have the same resources.

292
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,191
We are both probably going
to be able to deliver

293
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,861
the same quality of listings
for her to look at.

294
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,573
I just need to make sure
that she wants to spend more time with me.

295
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,909
-[Alexandra] It will be great.
-We'll be in touch for sure.

296
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,537
-Awesome, thanks. Bye.
-Take care, we'll be in touch. Bye!

297
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,915
Okay, so...

298
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,502
[sighs] That wasn't what I thought
it was gonna be.

299
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,379
I know. I'm gonna stress eat. [chuckles]

300
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,214
[Christine] No, I know. I know.

301
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,258
That stresses me out.

302
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,469
It's gonna really hurt 
your feelings when I get this.

303
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,638
How are you gonna deal
with this, Chrishell?

304
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,274
[whimpering]

305
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,943
I know, baby. I know, Papa's here.

306
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,612
Um, what's everybody doing tomorrow?

307
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,448
[Maya] We're doing the Broker's Open,

308
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,450
and then I'm catching actually the red eye

309
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,869
because I'm having my first ultrasound
the next day.

310
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,621
-[Mary] Yay!
-[Heather] Oh, that's so cool.

311
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,042
-I wanted my husband to be with me, and--
-[Christine] Of course. Yeah.

312
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,960
[Davina] That's so exciting.

313
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,879
Are you sure it's his baby?

314
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,007
Um... Last time I checked, it was, yeah.
[chuckles]

315
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,216
[laughs]

316
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,219
Um, you're gonna be back when?

317
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,180
-[Maya] So I'm flying Tuesday night.
-[Heather] We need you back.

318
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,848
-I'll be back Friday.
-Okay.

319
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,642
'Cause I have, like, uh,
showings on Saturday and Sunday.

320
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,602
[Davina] Here? Yeah.

321
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,773
Yeah, just showings, showings. I mean,
I need closing. That's what I need.

322
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,691
[Heather] We all need that, right? Yeah.

323
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:23,321
So, you guys, I have
my friend-slash-client coming in.

324
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,032
His name's Brandon.
I showed him the 40-million-dollar house.

325
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,909
-Awesome. Amazing.
-Oh, wow. How did it go?

326
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,285
[Heather] Really, really well.

327
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,870
Are you sure you don't want to get in?

328
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,413
I'm deciding not to swim today.

329
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,457
I think it's absolutely amazing.

330
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,752
He has someone that he thinks
would be interested.

331
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,337
Like, a Chinese investor.

332
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,881
-Is he a playboy model, too?
-[chuckles]

333
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,509
He should be, 
but maybe you can, um, check him out--

334
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,927
I'll be the judge of that.

335
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,597
Oh, my God. If that guys buys it, you have 
to get your friend the best gift ever.

336
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,350
I know. Well, I told him I'd give him
a referral if he obviously--

337
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,560
He's not buying it, guys.
My client's buying it.

338
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,354
[Maya] 
Christine, you have to show some support.

339
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,023
-No, I'm happy for you.
-[Maya] Yeah, right.

340
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,278
In the meantime, let me work on
my $500,000 condo buyer.

341
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,656
-That would be awesome.
-Hey, everything counts.

342
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,242
-Everything counts. Including leases.
-Seriously, money is money.

343
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,159
[Maya] I agree.

344
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,328
-Hello. Hi.
-[Heather] Hi!

345
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,872
-Oh, here he is.
-[Brandon] Hello.

346
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,084
-Hi, welcome to my second home.
-[Brandon] Hey, how are you?

347
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,419
-Great place.
-Thank you.

348
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,879
-It's not mine, but thank you.
-You look fantastic, as always.

349
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,256
- How's everything?
-Good.

350
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,966
-Did you talk to him?
-A little bit.

351
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,343
I gave some hints. So I just need
a little bit more information.

352
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,429
[Christine] <i>There's no competition</i>
<i>between Heather and I.</i>

353
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,473
I was the first person to show
the property and I'm gonna be the last.

354
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,933
[Heather] Jason.

355
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,643
-Hey, how are you?
-[Brandon] Good, how are you?

356
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,770
-Brandon.
-Brandon Larkin. Very nice to meet you.

357
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,523
-You as well. Heather's told me about you.
-How's it going? I'm Brett.

358
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,607
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure.

359
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,818
This is quite a crew you guys have here.

360
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,404
Yeah, this is our office.
This is the team. Wanna meet the team?

361
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:50,199
Mary, Christine, Davina,
Maya, and Chrishell.

362
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,284
Hi!

363
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,368
-Pleasure to meet you.
-And the dogs.

364
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,871
Let me get you a water.
And then we can sit down there...

365
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,372
-Sure.
-...and discuss everything.

366
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,040
Excuse me. Thank you.

367
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,417
[Heather] Excuse me, baby.

368
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,378
[Heather] <i>Are those frosted tips?</i>

369
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,172
<i>Like, people are still doing that?</i>

370
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,467
I feel like he could have been
a Backstreet Boy in his previous life.

371
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,552
Like, he wanted to be a little bit.

372
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,680
It's like, Heather's new boyfriend
or something?

373
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,350
[Christine] 
I mean, they look really cute together.

374
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,603
So tell me, you--
Tell me what the situation is.

375
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,064
I know you saw Hillside
and you have somebody who's interested?

376
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,359
Exactly. He's been looking for something.
It needs to be very LA.

377
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,571
You know, he wants a Hollywood lifestyle.
He wants something that nobody else has.

378
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,198
[Brett] And you saw the TV that comes up?

379
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,825
This house has tons of things
that no other house has.

380
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,077
I think they're just friends, though.

381
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,540
[Brandon] Heather, correct me if I'm wrong 
on this, but this is the last one

382
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,793
that has the zoning ability to be able
to build it with this square footage?

383
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,921
-Of that size, yes.
-[Brett] You won't see anything that size.

384
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,508
There's a Hillside ordinance that took
effect last year, drastically reducing

385
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,135
the size of properties you can build
based on the land,

386
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,972
so in order to build a house that big now,
you'd have to have acreage.

387
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,974
And there's no such thing as acreage
in the Hills.

388
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,309
You won't see that again.

389
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,353
There's nothing that compares
to this house.

390
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,064
When dealing with billionaires,
they want what nobody else can have.

391
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,399
They don't want just another house
based on money.

392
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,859
The money has to make sense,

393
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,904
but want something to be really unique.
This moat--

394
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,822
It's the longest pool
in the Hollywood Hills.

395
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,367
See, now I have to tell you,
that's what my client would love.

396
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,286
And I know it's tough to walk
through a house without it being finished,

397
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,497
but the good side is,
you're the only person seeing it.

398
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,542
A handful of people are seeing it. We have
the exclusive on the house right now.

399
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,461
The more that we can do visually,
the better we're gonna be,

400
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,588
and with numbers,
because there's a language barrier.

401
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,758
Let's put a really good packet together
of the renderings,

402
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,802
a list of all the amenities.

403
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,429
Uh, perhaps we have some photos
of the furniture

404
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,472
-and the artwork.
-Okay.

405
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,142
And just try to paint the picture.
At least enough to get him out here.

406
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,727
Gentlemen, this sounds great.

407
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,397
-It was a pleasure. Cheers.
-It was a pleasure, man.

408
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,898
-Very good to meet you.
-Yeah, you as well.

409
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,525
-Heather, always a pleasure to see you.
-[Jason] Take care.

410
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,486
-Ladies, it was a pleasure. Take care.
-[Jason] Stop by anytime, my man.

411
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,196
-Thank you so much, guys.
-Yeah, good job.

412
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,032
[Heather] Are you guys gonna be 
happy for me or jealous?

413
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,326
A little bit of both.

414
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,621
Okay, all y'all relax.
She hasn't sold it yet, okay?

415
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:05,459
Come on. 
You guys are getting so hyped. Jesus.

416
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,045
[Heather]<i> I love these girls,</i>
<i>but they're definitely catty.</i>

417
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,173
I have a chance to make a ton of money 
and I'm sure they want

418
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,883
a piece of the pie as well.

419
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,599
[Chrishell] You know, wanted 
to get together with the pooches

420
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,351
and just basically tell you, you know,
in a casual setting,

421
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,438
I do think 
that with a new, first-time buyer,

422
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,941
I just did this myself,
so I feel like I can be better equipped

423
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,485
to kind of, like, help you
through the process.

Hi!

00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,955
-How are you, babe?
-Good, how are you?

429

-Good to see you.
-You too.

430

-You have to drink the whole thing

-Uh, delicious. I love wine.

Let's get you a drink.

I'm such a dog lover.
Obviously you are, too.

435
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,721
So-- Oh, no.

436
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,599
Sorry, one second.

Cheers to Sunday.

441
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,610
I don't have a ton of clients.

I really would be dedicated to you.

445
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,162
And all my clients are all best friends.
Like, they all come to the parties

446
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,789
and we go out, and I love that.

447
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,334
So I feel like you and I would have
an amazing bond, you know?

448
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,127
So I found this for Norman.

449
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,338
-Little goodies for you.
-[barks]

450
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,964
-[Chrishell] Do you like it?
-[Alexandra] Oh, wow.

451
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,925
-Aw, he approves.
-I know.

452
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,718
I have more experience.

453
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:41,722
Chrishell's pretty new to the office, and
I think she's new to real estate as well.

454
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,226
Cheers to being smart enough
to pick me as your agent.

455
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,477
Cheers.

456
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,439
That's surprisingly really good.

457
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,570
<i>♪ Da-- Da-- Dangerous ♪</i>

458
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,410
<i>♪ I'm a bit dangerous ♪ </i>

459
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,412
-[Mary] Um, Christine?
-Mm-hmm.

460
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,996
Did you get flowers again?

461
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,498
Yeah, I did.

462
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,291
[Maya] By who?

463
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,295
Like, you get more flowers
than anyone I have ever seen.

464
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,756
I'm glad that they're 
from this person, actually.

465
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,842
-It's a new guy?
-Okay. Uh, do tell.

466
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,469
It's a new guy I've been talking to, 
but he's really cute.

467
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,346
Like, blonde hair,
blue eyes, he's really tall.

468
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,432
-Picture, please.
-[Davina] Yeah, I agree.

469
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,726
This is, like, a terrible,
like, not a great photo.

470
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,145
-Pass it around for the class, please.
-Good body.

471
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,106
I had to, like, get that photo out of him.

472
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,526
He didn't want to send it, but I was like,
"Oh, just send a little shirtless selfie,

473
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,654
never hurt nobody." I wanted to see
what I was working with, you know?

474
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,115
I love that he's pulling down his shorts,

475
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,827
like, "What are you gonna see
if I pull it down a little further?"

476
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,495
What?

477
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,956
I need to see what's going on
underneath the shirt.

478
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,999
I want to live your life.

479
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,710
I was actually at the Beverly Wilshire
on a date with this guy

480
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,463
and I thought he was so cute.
And he had a button-up shirt.

481
00:20:55,546 --> 00:21:00,259
And then he goes to sit down,
and the button comes off

482
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,095
and there's 
a belly hanging over his pants.

483
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,597
And I was like--

484
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,432
[Davina] Oh, gosh.

485
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,934
I was like, "I should've gotten 
a shirtless photo

486
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:09,935
before I went out with him.

487
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,438
So it's just like, you never know.
I'm not into the surprise body,

488
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,523
so I told him to send me
a photo like that.

489
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,150
I love hearing your stories.

490
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,612
[Davina] Guys, we should probably do 
some work. We are at the office, you know?

491
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,988
[Chrishell] Yes. Sorry.

492
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,992
Sir, I'm so sorry we're not talking
about real estate, sir.

493
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,369
Please don't punish me, I'm so sorry.

494
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,381
Heather, got some good news.

495
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,925
-[Heather] Uh-oh. What?
-Remember Kelsey?

496
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,051
Yeah.

497
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,719
Kelsey's coming back literally right now.

498
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,637
Okay.

499
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,138
So, any second she's gonna show up.

500
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,225
I think they're trying to get the house
off the market before your broker open.

501
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,768
-Really?
-That's what it sounded like.

502
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,520
-So he loved it.
-Yeah.

503
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:56,232
If this offer comes in, this house will be
sold within 48 hours of hitting the market

504
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,484
which is incredible. That's pretty rare.

505
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,402
I'd say that happens
maybe ten percent of the time.

506
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,113
-Hey, Kelsey.
-Hey, guys.

507
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,241
You have good news for us?

508
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,619
I do. Thanks for meeting me
before the broker starts.

509
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,913
-Nice to see you.
-Hi, how are you?

510
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,164
-Good.
-What's going on?

511
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,250
Um, so my client 
is interested in the home.

512
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
He wants to submit 
an offer of five point three.

513
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,003
-Five point three. Okay.

514
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,422
If we can get it today
before the broker's open starts.

515
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,966
-You wanna take it off market right now?
-[Kelsey] We do.

516
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,678
Yeah, I need to call them and see
if that number would work.

517
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,805
-Go ahead, take a minute.
-Okay, give me a minute.

518
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,056
Good. That works.

519
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,892
So he really liked it?

520
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,561
He does. It's perfect for them.

521
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,064
Hi.

522
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,774
So I have some news.

523
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,569
I showed the home to a prospective buyer.

524
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,029
And I just met with the agent
and they want to submit an offer.

525
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:47,575
In order to take it off the market today,
what number do you want?

526
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,579
All right, Kelsey.

527
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,416
So I just spoke to my client,
five point three is a little bit low.

528
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,709
Okay.

529
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,004
They are willing to settle today,
take it off the market,

530
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:04,758
but the number, the final number is
$5,425,000.

531
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,302
-Okay.
-And that's it.

532
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,053
So we can't go any lower than that.

533
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,139
All right. Well, I have him on standby,

534
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,892
so I'll just shoot him a text
really fast and I'll let you guys know.

535
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:13,893
-Okay.
-All right.

536
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,940
-It's exciting, though. 
-Mm-hmm.

537
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,109
[Heather] I mean, but here's the thing,

538
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,904
everyone loved this home,

539
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,823
so if they can't come to the number
we want, forget it.

540
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,158
I'm totally cool with that.

541
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,077
Are you guys--
You're positive that's it, right?

542
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,079
Yeah. There's no wiggle room.
No. Absolutely not.

543
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,750
Yeah. We should 
definitely play hardball right now.

544
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,171
I mean, there's nothing we can do.

545
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,506
That's the number they want.
I'm not gonna go against it.

546
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:49,637
[Kelsey] All right.

547
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,139
-[Heather] What?
-You got yourself a deal.

548
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,307
-Seriously?
-Yep.

549
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,726
-Today. Yes.
-Really? Shake on it. Okay.

550
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,062
-Congratulations.
-You guys got to take it off today.

551
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,647
-No broker's open.
-No.

552
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,231
-All right.
-Congratulations.

553
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,692
-Thank you, nice doing business with you.
-Thank you.

554
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,236
-I'll send over the paperwork. Okay. Bye.
-[Heather] Thanks, Kelsey.

555
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,494
Wait, am I imagining?
Did it really happen?

556
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,411
No, that happened.

557
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,081
This gives me confidence,
because it's been so long for me--

558
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,624
That's a six-figure commission.

559
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,125
-Yay!
-That's big.

560
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,045
Can we celebrate, please?
I've had so much stress, I need to--

561
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,130
Yeah. Well, first I'm gonna jump
in that pool.

562
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,883
Okay. Can I push you? Please? Please?

563
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,343
Let me get my jacket off.

564
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,730
[Christine] Any good homes, Maya?

565
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,608
Uh, there are a lot of nice ones,
you know?

566
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,278
Like, I mean, if I lived there I would
go to, like, open houses and stuff, but

567
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,241
I haven't seen anything
for the last year and a half.

568
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,579
[Maya] The silent of the lamb.

569
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,665
[laughs]

570
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,208
You what?

571
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,627
-The silent of the lamb.
-[chuckles]

572
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,672
[phone ringing]

573
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,969
This is Chrishell Hartley.

574
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,890
Oh, hi, Alexandra, how are you?

575
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,226
Good, thank you.

576
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,314
Uh, she's in the office,
just give me one second.

577
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,942
This is Alexandra. She asked--

578
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,194
Um, do you want me to put you on speaker?

579
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,864
Okay, one second.

580
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,617
-Yes, we're both here.
-Hi.

581
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,953
-[Alexandra]<i> Hi, Christine.</i>

582
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,414
<i>-I'm good. How are you?</i>
<i>-</i>Good, thanks.

583
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:45,127

584
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,755

586
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,969

587
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,637
<i>After much thought...</i>

588
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,226
<i>I've decided to go with Chrishell. </i>

589
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,523
<i>Um, I just feel she'll be </i>
<i>the best fit right now. </i>

590
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:11,737
<i>Uh, but I really do appreciate</i>
<i>all the time you gave, Christine, to me. </i>

591
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,701
<i>And, um, yeah, you know, I'm looking</i>
<i>forward to working close with Chrishell.</i>

592
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,454
[Chrishell] Oh, well, thank you so much.

593
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,582
-We'll talk soon.
<i>-Sounds good.</i>

594
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,541
