[laughs]

152
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,089
Let me see.

153
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,008
-Pregnant.
-You're pregnant!

154
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,510
-I'm sorry, I just screamed at you.
-I don't know what to do.

155
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,095
I'm so excited!

156
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,055
Oh!

157
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,474
-I need water.
-What do we do? Here.

158
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,810
Okay, don't...
First of all, don't tell anyone.

159
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,314
-Okay, I won't.
-My mind is, like, spinning right now.

160
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,774
-Do you wanna sit?
-I know, right?

161
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,484
I wanna be the first to say that to you.

162
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,401
Sit.

163
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,195
My heartbeat is, like, I'm so excited.

164
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,739
But at the same time, 
because it's so early,

165
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,659
-I just hope it's gonna be okay, you know?
-Yeah.

166
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,702
I'm happy that I got to be here for you.

167
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,829
-No one knows. Like, you're the first one.
-Okay.

168
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,249
Pretend like you're just like, la-la-la,
nonchalant, even.

169
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,085
Nothing was told to me today.

170
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,088
I'm just gonna hug you one more time.
Congratulations.

171
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,965
Thank you.

172
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,560
[Christine] 
Mary, can I show you something?

173
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,188
This new MLS has me
all sorts of whacked out.

174
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,856
So let's do Beverly Hills.

175
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,859
-Let's do Bel Air.
-Is that Hollywood?

176
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,237
Special order for Christine.

177
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,406
Oh, really? Aw!

178
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,618
-[Maya] For your house.
-[Christine] Oh, my God, so cute.

179
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,704
-Hi. Thank you.
-[Davina] Christine!

180
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,581
Can I film this
and send it to my boyfriend?

181
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,250
[Davina] Those are gorgeous.

182
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,045
"Hey, Christine, 
so glad we were able to reconnect,

183
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,549
and it's been awesome
having you as a tour guide around LA.

184
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,759
Can't wait for you to find me
the house of my dreams

185
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,221
so we can both really say,
'Look how far we've come.'

186
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,390
-Lots of love, Jacob."
-[all] Aw.

187
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,975
-That's so cute!
-Aw!

188
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,935
That's really cute.

189
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,353
What a sweetheart!

190
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,147
So you had dinner with him?
What happened?

191
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:48,069
Yeah, we had dinner and we had
a really good time and, um,  I don't know.

192
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,612
Obviously, it went well.

193
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,366
So what is it about him that you liked
or that you didn't like?

194
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,410
I mean, he's really sweet.

195
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,246
-[Davina] Okay.
-He's so nice. He's so funny.

196
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,666
But I just don't get 
that, like, passion and chemistry.

197
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,877
You don't want to jump his bones?
Yeah.

198
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,838
But, I mean, I think you should give it
at least a couple of dates.

199
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,548
I mean, sometimes it takes time.

200
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,093
He might grow on you a little bit more.
And if not, then you guys remain friends.

201
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,970
I don't want someone
who grows on me, though.

202
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,431
I want someone who I like instantly.
Like, wow.

203
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,474
I wanted that too.

204
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,184
In the long run,
that's not the best thing.

205
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,102
I agree. My husband grew on me.

206
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,022
[Davina] But you do have to, 
you know, feel attraction.

207
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,316
Christine, I think you should
totally go for him.

208
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,276
I agree with Mary. Give him a chance.

209
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,944
-I think so, too.
-What's it gonna hurt?

210
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,615
Flowers are so sweet,
so I'm voting for him.

211
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,950
[chuckles]
Do we get to vote? Are we voting?

212
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,327
Who is Team Jacob?

213
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,704
Maybe I'll entertain dinner
with him again, you know.

214
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,831
-Yay!
-Maybe I will.

215
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,876
-[Maya] We totally sold her on Jacob.
-Okay, fine.

216
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,669
[Maya chuckles]

217
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,049
[whimpers]

218
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,761
[Chrishell] Hi.

219
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,722
Um, I have, um, good and bad news.

220
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,267
Um, okay, so I have 
an offer for Tara Drive.

221
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:06,356
It's obviously beautiful, and I do think
that it's gonna sell quickly.

222
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,067
Well, let me get some stats 
of what you are looking for

223
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,401
and give you my information.

224
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,986
So that's super exciting,

225
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,156
but it's contingent 
that their house sells.

226
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,242
-If the buyer's house sells?
-Yeah.

227
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,160
So it's not just a straight offer.

228
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,079
Is their house on the market already?

229
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,208
It's not, but it's ready to go
on the market, so...

230
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,043
There's a couple of ways we can do it.

231
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,338
One, the buyer can release
non-refundable funds.

232
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,508
The other way to do it is just
to not offer any non-refundable funds

233
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,219
and to get into escrow,
but you have to give the seller an out.

234
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,805
So if the seller gets a better offer,
they can kick the buyer out.

235
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,224
-But they won't lose any money?
-They won't lose any money.

236
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:46,437
When you release non-refundable funds,
basically that's you saying, like,

237
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,606
"Okay, I'm putting all this money at risk.

238
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,110
If for some reason 
I don't end up buying your house,

239
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,446
now you get to keep all that money
for the inconvenience."

240
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,949
We can triple end it.
We can represent the seller,

241
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,411
the buyer, and the buyer's home, and maybe
even the buyer of the buyer's home.

242
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,831
Okay, that would be amazing.
But no pressure.

243
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,792
-There <i>is</i> pressure. Let's get this done.
-All right.

244
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,919
[Jason] <i>This is </i>
<i>a really complicated transaction.</i>

245
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:14,007
That said, I expect anyone at this office
to close it and that includes Chrishell.

246
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,050
Hey, Mark, it's Chrishell Hartley.

247
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,512
I am just calling you to let you know
that we got an offer on the house,

248
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,891
which is amazing, but I need to talk
to you a little bit about it,

249
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,310
so just give me a call back when you can.
Thanks.

-Oh, wow. It's a lot of light.

255
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,287
-I know. It's gorgeous.
-And I love those skylights.

256
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,081
I'm the Director of New Developments
at the Oppenheim Group.

257
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,001
Jason hired me 
to kind of oversee the process,

258
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,297
so I'm working with lots of developers
in luxury condominium high-rises.

259
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,549
[Davina] So this is a penthouse
that we're going into.

260
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,968
This is a furnished model.
It's so beautiful.

261
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,178
[Chrishell] Oh, wow.

262
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,351
-[Chrishell] I like how bright it is.
-Isn't it gorgeous with the high ceilings?

263
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,102
You get your own sunroof.

264
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,480
And a little tequila
to make you feel at home. [chuckles]

265
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,649
-[Chrishell] Always a good time.
-This is the master.

266
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:14,901
[Davina] It just feels so open.

267
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,779
It's very inviting
and the views, of course, I love it.

268
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,783
I have two people off the top 
of my head I'll bring in to see this.

269
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,785
[Davina] Oh, cool.
I'd love to get you involved.

270
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:27,288
It was fun to hang out with you guys
the other night outside the office.

271
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,707
I know. I'm happy we all
got to be there for Mary, too.

272
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,584
-That's cool. I'm happy for her.
-I know.

273
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,170
They're so sweet together,
but I was a little worried for her

274
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,548
after their, like, 
rocky anniversary dinner or whatever.

275
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,760
Like, her reaction 
kind of made me, you know, wonder.

276
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,346
When I met her and him, I thought 
it was more like good for her,

277
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,474
like it was her boy toy, and then
when they got engaged, I was like,

278
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:51,521
"Wait, what?" I thought she was, you know,
just enjoying the fruits of her labor.

279
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,480
[chuckles] Yeah.

280
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,982
You know when you're 25,

281
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,818
think about what you wanted
and who you were with

282
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,195
-versus like, now, what you--
-Oh, I know.

283
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,697
-It's so crazy.
-It's so different.

284
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,200
I mean, I wouldn't wanna be
with the person I was dating at 25.

285
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,326
Oh, my God.

286
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,414
I did not know who I was at 25...
and I didn't know what I wanted,

287
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,543
because actually if I ended up
with the person I was with at 25,

288
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,379
I would want to kill myself. [laughs]

289
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,509
And, yeah, you can Google that.
You were a dick. [laughs]

290
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,636
Sorry.

291
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,138
Honestly, I don't know if it's fair

292
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,765
to even ask someone at 25
if they want kids or not.

293
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,600
He does want kids, I guess.

294
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,313
-She's aware of it, you know?
-Oh, yeah, she can make her own decisions.

295
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,940
So obviously I want Mary to be happy

296
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,110
and I hope that this is
the right move for them.

297
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,903
As somebody that is married,

298
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:45,450
and I'm married to a wonderful person,
sometimes it's freaking hard.

299
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,995
So I just hope that, 
you know, at 25 years old,

300
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,915
he knows, you know, what that entails,
asking someone to marry you,

301
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,460
because it's not always easy.

302
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,212
Does Romain pay for his own share
of stuff, do you think?

303
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,464
Not much, I think.

304
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,882
So she pays for everything?

305
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,885
Yeah. I mean, I don't know him super well.

306
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,428
-I've heard he's a baker.
-Yeah.

307
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,056
She's gonna do a prenup, right?

308
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,892
I don't know. 
I haven't talked to her about it yet.

309
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,227
-We can recommend it, but--
-I'm not gonna recommend it.

310
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,812
-I won't recommend it either.
-[laughs]

311
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,273
You know, she's obviously gonna do
what she wants to do.

312
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,193
He's gonna do what he wants to do,
and hopefully that aligns.

313
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:25,365
I mean, it's possible that it works out,
but it's risky, you know? [chuckles]

314
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,422
[Heather] I'm so excited to see it. 
I cannot wait.

315
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,008
-I hope that it's way better.
-[Brett] Oh, that makes two of us.

316
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:44,967
[Heather] Yes!

317
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,469
[gasps]

318
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,554
Yes! I love it

319
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,058
[Heather] I love the couch.

320
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,143
It's white, exactly like what we wanted.

321
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,479
So let's see the kitchen.

322
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,565
Awesome. Simple.

323
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,235
I didn't wanna take away
from the countertops.

324
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,361
I feel like it's perfect.

325
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,780
[Brett] No, it's clean, it's modern.

326
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,574
I love the chandelier. That's perfect.

327
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,535
It ties in that table so nice.

328
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,620
So I feel like this is
super universal now.

329
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,123
Anyone can walk in
and envision themselves. I love it.

330
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,543
I love it, too. I mean, it could've been
done last week, but I love it.

331
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,753
Let's go upstairs.

332
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,135
Perfect, I love it.

333
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,138
[Brett] This could be my bedroom.
I really like it.

334
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,306
-See the view?
-Yeah, let's go outside.

335
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,061
[Heather] 
So private up here, don't you think?

336
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,439
-Yeah, this is great.
-Oh, it's beautiful.

337
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,316
-[Brett] You'll sell the shit out of this.
-Yay! I hope.

338
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,818
-You will.
-It's gonna happen quick.

339
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,361
-It's got to.
-Yeah. You will.

340
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,447
I got my license when I was 27,

341
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,492
and literally a few months later,
I sold my first home,

342
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,078
which was, like, around 7.2 million.

343
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,915
For me to have to <i>prove</i>
that I am a good agent

344
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,169
and connected and a strong worker

345
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:05,548
is kind of bullshit
because I've brought clients and deals in,

346
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,592
and I shouldn't have to defend myself.

347
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,720
-Let's chat about what happened here...
-Okay, what's up?

348
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,514
...because honestly this house 
could've been in escrow already.

349
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,058
You could've had an open house.
It could've been staged and finished

350
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,560
-and photographed a week ago.
-Yeah.

351
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,353
I wanna know what happened.

352
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,856
[sighs] Um...

353
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,316
I definitely...

354
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,278
let my personal life get 
in the middle of work.

355
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,030
I took a call with Nick

356
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,909
right in the middle of going over 
the staging of the house so...

357
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,370
It's hard, 'cause I never know
when he's gonna call.

358
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,956
You know, your priority's to your clients

359
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,958
-and to selling homes.
-Yeah.

360
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,211
So that's where my interests lie.

361
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,839
So I do not wanna minimize
and I fully respect

362
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,799
-that you have a lot on your plate...
-Yeah.

363
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,885
...but this is the priority.

364
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,803
-I know. I'm here to work.
-Okay.

365
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,430
And that needs to be my focus.

366
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,182
But it's not the end of the world.

367
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,768
You can recover. What you need
to do is sell it for a great price

368
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,646
-and everybody will forget everything.
-I know. Okay.

369
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,814
-And no phone calls during the open house.
-Yeah.

375
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,463
-Uh, it's fine.

How's it going with Lionel?

378
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,763
Oh, um, I walked Chrishell
through the building.

379
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,847
-[Maya] Did you?
-[Davina] Yeah.

380
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:41,018
I feel like she does wanna learn about
new developments, so that's cool. Yeah.

381
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,814
Actually, Chrishell was asking
a lot of questions about Mary and Romain.

382
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,400
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, like does he even make money?

383
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,820
Like, does he have a job?
Does he even pay for anything?

384
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,321
That's not cool, you know?

385
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,409
Like, and then I feel like, "Oh, are you
gonna talk about <i>me </i>behind my back, too?"

386
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,743
She's so nice to Mary,

387
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,372
but she didn't say anything
about how she really feels to her face.

388
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,624
I mean, I get the concern,
at the same time.

389
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,709
[Davina] Sure.

390
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,545
-it's none of our business.
-It's none of our business.

391
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,505
But I feel like if you have
such strong opinions,

392
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,592
don't come talk to me about it.
Go talk to Mary about it, you know?

393
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,261
I'm gonna have Mary's back more than,
like, Chrishell.

394
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,887

404
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,629
-Able to do that?
-Yeah.

405
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,380
Yeah, 'cause it's just an appliance.

-Oh, what's up, girl?
-Hey.

407
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,216
-[Jhoiey] Hi.
-[Jason] Thanks for making it.

408
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,635
-Of course!
-Mwah!

409
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,803
Oh, my God, it looks so good.

410
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,890
-[Jason] You haven't seen it in a while.
-No, it's come such a long way.

411
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,726
[Jason] I wanna show you one thing.
We've got this working.

412
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,270
This is the television.

413
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,105
Boom!

414
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,608
[Mary] That is epic.

415
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,360
Where'd you guys get that idea?

416
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:16,030
-Oh, just in my head one night.
-[Jhoiey] He's crazy sometimes.

417
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,074
Eighty-five-inch TV right in front.

418
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,159
[Mary] That is so cool. 
That is incredible.

419
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,869
Yeah. I'm pretty happy with it.

420
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,163
-How much did that cost to do?
-[laughs]

421
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,582
Uh, almost 35,000 with everything.

422
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,043
Your TV cost 35,000? [laughs]

423
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,045
Well, no, the TV cost 5,000,
but you have to--

424
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,964
-But the whole TV system cost... Wow.
-You dig down, pour...

425
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,050
It's basically a safe room down there.

426
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,635
It's basically a bunker.

427
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,387
[laughs]

428
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,349
Now you've got the industrial
kind of thing. Organic.

429
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,768
Well, the last one we did
was more contemporary,

430
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,521
but this is more my style: 
one-story vaulted ceilings,

431
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,733
wood, metal, timeless, more sophisticated.
 I really like it.

432
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,318
-I love it.
-This is more me.

433
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,570
So Jason and I used to date,

434
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,739
and, yeah, that didn't work out.

435
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,534
I think in most cases,
it's very hard to work with an ex, but...

436
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,245
it works for us.

437
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,998
So it's nice to be able to offer
my opinion objectively.

438
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,251
And then this is gonna be glass.
One piece of glass.

439
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,337
By the way, 
I believe I told you to do glass there

440
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,757
-instead of the other thing, didn't I?
-Instead of metal? Yes, you might have.

441
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,844
And then this is gonna be a neon sign
with my favorite poem.

442
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,138
So it'll become like a bar vibe over here.

443
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,180
Here, let's go outside.

444
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,349
We're just getting started on the pool.

445
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,894
So the coping goes first and then they're
gonna float everything around that.

446
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:32,523
Then all of this is
gonna be fake grass, the entire deck.

447
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,025
The brick on all the pillars,
are you leaving it brick?

448
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,360
-Yes.
-Oh, yeah, for sure.

449
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,070
-Okay.
-It's called thin brick,

450
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,530
which you'll normally see.

451
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,866
I hate the word veneer,
'cause everyone thinks it's fake.

452
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,951
It's actually brick. It's just thin.

453
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,412
-It;s just the thinner--
-So let's go with thin brick, deal?

454
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,747
[Jhoiey laughs]

455
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,916
-He's making up his own words.
-This is gonna be a fireplace

456
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,585
right here, too, in the corner.

457
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,170
What's up, guys?

458
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,212
What's up, girl?

459
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,130
Hey.

460
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,592
I was just here and Mary told me
she's going to be here,

461
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,135
so I figured I'd come say hi.

462
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,596
-Oh, I wanna brag about the house.
-I know. Wow.

463
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,514
-Hey, hon. You look cute.
-You look nice too.

464
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,725
-I love your jumper.
-Oh, thank you.

465
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,894
-Wow, this is so nice!
-You know Jhoiey, right?

466
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,396
I'm sorry, I got distracted. Maya.

467
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,941
Oh, by the way, we're gonna have a huge
pool party/dinner party when I'm done.

468
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,026
When is it gonna be ready?

469
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,278
I don't know.
Jhoiey, when's it gonna be ready?

470
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,822
-The pressure is on.
-Uh-oh, here comes another fight.

471
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,283
[Jason] We're gonna go inside.
We have a ton to go over.

472
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,993
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

473
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,578
[Maya] What's going on, girl?

474
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,581
[Mary] Nothing. Just coming to the house
to take a look a look at it.

475
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,374
He's just, like, done so much to it.

476
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,920
I was here a couple months ago
and it just looks completely different.

477
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,047
It's the first time I see it. I like it.

478
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,298
So how have you been?

479
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,257
-Good! 
-Yeah?

480
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:43,427
-Yeah, really good. Yeah.
-What's going on with you and Romain?

481
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,847
I know it's been kind of like, 
you know, the girls are, like,

482
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,601
chit-chatting in the office and making,
I guess, some comments about,

483
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,646
-you know, him being young and--
-Who was talking about stuff?

484
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,732
I guess, I don't know, Davina
and Chrishell were, like, talking about,

485
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,402
you know, I wonder if, like, you are,
like, supporting him or something.

486
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,988
But I get it, people talk.
They will always say something.

487
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,281
Yeah.

488
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,452
Well, I don't support him at all,

489
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,914
but if they have questions, if they have
something to say, they can just ask me.

490
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,499
What... Was there anything else said?

491
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,544
-No. That's what, as far as I know.
-Okay.

492
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,379
If they want to know,
they can come to me.

493
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,506
-Right.
-They don't need to talk behind my back.

494
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,012
<i>♪ I hope my fears don't catch me ♪</i>

495
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:34,061
<i>♪ And you won't see me when I fall ♪</i>

496
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,439
[Chrishell] Do any of you guys have 
an agent that works in Vegas?

497
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,858
-I do.
-I need a referral.

498
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,067
[Heather] Yeah.

499
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,402
It's from ten to two.

500
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,988
Are we still going 
to the Century next week?

501
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,448
-Wasn't there something--
-I have to talk to Eric about that.

502
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,533
All right.

503
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:51,579
-Hey. Sorry, um, do you have a second?
-Yeah, go ahead.

504
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,000
So, unfortunately, um,
remember the last time I told you

505
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,793
they had an offer in, we're in escrow,

506
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,879
but it was contingent
on their house selling?

507
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,255
-On the Encino property?
-Yeah.

508
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,258
So we're basically to the point now

509
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:08,846
where their deposit would be at risk and 
they've taken their offer off the table

510
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,931
'cause they're afraid
their house is not gonna sell.

511
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,809
-So my escrow fell through.
-Hmm.

512
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,186
[Jason] Well, where's the backup offer?

513
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,105
Well, this is the only offer I have.

514
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,732
Well, we need a backup offer.

515
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,484
If you think that there's an escrow
that could fall out,

516
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,863
then you gotta have a backup offer,
maybe even an offer before that.

517
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,907
Two backup offers. 
I don't wanna hear

518
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,868
you coming to me saying I lost
an escrow and I don't have a backup offer.

519
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,870
Did you continue to have open houses

520
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,956
and broker opens and continue to make
phone calls and send out emails

521
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,460
and do print marketing? If you can get
one offer, you can get two offers.

522
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,463
Okay. I did show the house privately
a couple times,

523
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,924
but I didn't hold it open
after I was in escrow, but--

524
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,218
You gotta keep working. 
I mean what, you lost your first deal?

525
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,846
-Not a good batting average.
-[Chrishell] Well...

526
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,682
[Jason] I mean, I lose maybe one
in every 20 or 30 deals.

527
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,770
Well, then maybe this is just my one
and I'm getting it out of the way,

528
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,939
and then all the rest of them
will be real successful.

529
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,775
I don't want you coming back
and saying, "I fell out of escrow

530
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,694
and I don't have a backup offer
because I didn't continue to work hard."

531
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,613
I did show it privately a couple times--

532
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,823
Because now 
the client's not happy with us, right?

533
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,618
Because you got them excited,
they felt like they sold the house,

534
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,163
they might've made plans to, you know,
move or spend that money or do something,

535
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,207
and now, boom, we're back to square one.

536
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,876
I mean, listen, I'm not just gonna
judge you on one deal,

537
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,045
but, you know, it's not a great start.

538
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,590
All right. I'm going to hold it open
on Sunday, Tuesday.

539
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:30,052
I'll blast emails out. I'll call
some people that did come to see it,

540
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,845
to make sure they know
it's still available.

541
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,640
Let's get our marketing back.
Let's get people back to the house.

542
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,433
All right. Sorry. Thank you.

543
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:39,645
Let's get an ad in the LA Times,
get an ad in the MLS Caravan.

544
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,522
The whole team can send emails.
Tell everybody.

545
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,815
-Okay.
-All right.

546
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,857
Thank you.

547
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,571
You guys have anybody that's looking
to move to the Valley?

548
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,907
-[Maya] What happened?
-[Chrishell] I fell out of escrow.

549
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,035
What happened is that she fell out
of escrow on her deal

550
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,662
because she didn't have a backup offer.

551
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,540
We're back to square one.
So, lesson for everyone,

552
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,625
if they don't know this,
and I think everyone does,

553
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,378
use your first offer
to get a backup offer.

554
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,963
[Heather] It's not your fault.

555
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,924
If you don't have a backup offer,
you can't wait around for a backup offer.

556
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,343
Well, it <i>is</i> her fault, actually,

557
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,887
but, you know, you could've had
a couple more open houses.

558
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,265
You can go and sit
next to Jason, Christine.

559
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,393
[Christine] I'm just saying it happens. 
It's okay. She knows now.

560
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,310
It's not a perfect world

561
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,438
and not everyone has
a backup offer for every listing.

562
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,314
[Christine] But she knows now
that she should.

563
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,401
You know, you're the one that's 
missing out on a six-figure commission,

564
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,111
so I'm not trying to be the bad guy here,

565
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,905
but, you know, 
you're batting zero right now

566
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:36,243
so let's close maybe our next 15 deals
and then you'll be back to average.

567
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,954
Don't worry, like, it happens.

[sighs wearily]

575
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,315
Oh, this is so nice.
Have you guys been here before?

576
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,485
-I have, but only downstairs.
-[Christine] Yeah? It's super cute.

577
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,655
You know, it's nice to finally escape
from Jason and Brett. [chuckles]

578
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,492
Are they gonna show up from nowhere?
Like, they always show up.

579
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,243
-Probably!
-[woman] Hi, ladies.

580
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,205
Welcome to the District, I'll be helping
you out tonight, my name's Chanel.

581
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,998
I'll start with your drinks?

582
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,459
-Sauv blanc. Great, thank you.
-[Chanel] Yeah, definitely.

583
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,711
-Would you wanna do a New Zealand one?
-Wonderful.

584
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,797
-[Chanel] Okay, for yourself?
-Could I have a mojito.

585
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,881
[Chanel] Mojito.

586
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,967
-I'll do a champagne.
-Champagne.

587
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,011
-Mojito.
-And a mojito.

588
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,097
-A virgin one.
-Virgin.

589
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,807
[Christine] Four lemon drop shots, please.

590
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,726
-[Chanel] Sounds good. Thank you.
-Thank you.

591
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,480
Now we need to just work
on the 40-million-dollar houses.

592
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,940
I know!

593
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,026
I feel like my client, in his mind,
that wasn't even when he wanted.

594
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,985
-Jacob?
-Yeah.

595
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,238
-This is the guy that--
-Oh, my gosh.

596
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,115
-Yes, this is <i>the</i> Jacob.
-Okay.

597
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,367
-Cheers. Thank you.
-I'll grab some waters as well.

598
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,494
-Thank you. Cheers, ladies!
-Of course.

599
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,413
Cheers, guys.

600
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,166
-Yeah. Cheers.
-Cheers.

601
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,710
So I had buyers like that, actually.

602
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,840
Well, I have a question: you haven't
talked to him since the flowers?

603
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,007
Like, in person?

604
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,801
No, I haven't seen him since the flowers.

605
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,595
-[Chrishell] Could I see a picture of him?
-So here we go.

606
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,680
Yes!

607
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,765
Oh, he looks sexy.

608
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,309
Wait, I wanna see him.
I'm missing all the action.

609
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,061
-[cell phone rings]
-[gasps]

610
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,146
[laughs]

611
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,188
[Maya] Who is that?

612
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,523
Can I answer? Can I get it?

613
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,984
-Oh, that's Jacob.
-No, I'm busy.

614
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,819
Why? Let me answer!

615
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,904
I can't talk to him right now. I can't.

616
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,240
He's like my brother,
do you know what I mean?

617
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,576
It's like, I don't know,
I've known him since, like...

618
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,493
[Maya] Yeah.

619
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,120
[Chanel] Some lemon drop shots.

620
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,622
[Chrishell] Oh! Thank you.

621
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:49,960
All right, cheers.

622
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,379
-I'm not--
-[Christine] You gonna do it?

623
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,339
To the baby! [laughs]

624
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,009
-I'm sorry, Maya.
-That--

625
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,969
I'm kidding! I'm joking.

626
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,596
Why are you not drinking?

627
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,557
Well, I'm basically pregnant, ... it.

628
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,434
Good job, Chrishell. [chuckles]

629
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,561
-I forgot. I'm sorry.
-It's very early.

630
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,646
-Basically pregnant or you're pregnant?
-Well, I am.

631
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:14,151
-I am, but it's, like, so... It's fine.
-This is why I can't drink! I'm sorry.

632
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,195
This is great, though. This is great news.

633
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:20,407
It's great, but I just hope it's gonna,
you know, stay, right?

634
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,825
So that's why I'm like...

635
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm so sorry!

636
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,540
One sip of alcohol,
this one is already like...

637
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,750
[Davina] Done. Toast.

638
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,210
[Maya] Seriously.

639
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,047
Try to not tell Mary and Heather
or something? Or just keep it kind of--

640
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,800
I better not drink then because...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

641
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,150
Hi, babe!

642
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,694
-Hey!
-Hi, guys. How are you?

643
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,613
Hi, honey.

644
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,323
-You look cute.
-Thank you.

645
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,450
-Come on in. 
-You need a drink.

646
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,911
We have a few extra lemon drops
if you'd like one.

647
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,954
Ooh!

648
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,914
[Maya] So how was your day?

649
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,959
It was all right. 
I just did a walk through with a client,

650
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,920
and, um, it was kind of a disaster, but...

651
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,380
Oh, no, what happened?

652
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,631
It didn't go as...

653
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:22,261
So basically the seller moved out
and just left it a mess,

654
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:27,766
so I was trying to, like, scurry and 
clean everything up and stuff and...

655
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,477
It's much more responsibility
representing the buyer and the seller

656
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,397
because you're, you know,
at fault for everything, literally.

657
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,692
Yeah, that's true. But you also make,
like, a lot more money.

658
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,777
[Christine] Yeah, that's true.
Absolutely true.

659
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,071
-Yes, but I did find it--
-[Christine] So Mary's buying.

660
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,116
-Drinks on Mary. [chuckles]
-[Davina] Drinks on Mary!

661
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,075
[Mary] Oh, my gosh.

662
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,620
-Um... oh. So...
-[Davina] That's funny.

663
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,622
I'm just going to get this out, like,

664
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:55,752
in the open right away 
because I did speak to Maya the other day

665
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,546
and she just said that...

666
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,218
there was some talk 
about Romain and my relationship.

667
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,596
To be honest, I heard, 
like, you guys were talking.

668
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,890
But here's the thing: you guys are new.

669
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,979
How would you know anything about us?

670
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,649
I do want to make it clear
he's never asked me for a penny.

671
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,735
He pays for the two of us all the time.

672
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,405
It's frustrating that people are talking--

673
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,656
I swear to God,

674
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,074
I don't remember.

675
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,703
You did ask me about,
like, does he pay for stuff?

676
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,248
Yeah. And it's... I think it's because
you don't really know, you know?

677
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,750
Okay.

678
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,921
I'm gonna use the restroom.

679
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,591
-[Maya] Me, too. I have to pee, too.
-Crazy. I do, too.

680
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,972
You threw me under the bus to Mary
about that I asked,

681
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,017
like, if she paid for everything.

682
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,479
I was only asking because 
I legitimately was wondering

683
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,980
why there was all this concern.

684
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:00,233
[Davina] Well, I feel like she does know
that it was, like, about the kids

685
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,318
and about the money.

686
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,528
So those are the two general points
and you're like,

687
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,197
"For me, it was only about the kids."

688
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,785
Then I'm the one that obviously was
talking this shit about, uh, the money.

689
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,245
So I was like, "That's not the case,"
and so I feel because--

690
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:15,540
-So then you threw it on me.
-No. Maya's the one that told Mary,

691
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,459
"Oh, you know, 
they were talking about it."

692
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,379
So it's not like I was like,
"Hey, Mary, uh, by the way,

693
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,756
this is what was talked about,"
you know? So just know that.

694
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,551
The way that you 
brought it up to Mary sounded like

695
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,595
you were throwing me under the bus--

696
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,222
But you could've owned up to it

697
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:34,684
and said, "Oh, actually, I don't know him.
I don't know you very well."

698
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,728
And that's the reality of the situation.

699
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,730
Uh... Really?

700
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:42,484
It's just letting me know
who I can trust, who I can't.

701
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:46,947
Did you get your fried rice?

702
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,533
-[Maya] Yes. You want some?
-[Mary] Nah.
