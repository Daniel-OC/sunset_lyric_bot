Thank you, babe.

-Morning.
-Good morning.

4
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,086
-I had so much fun last night.
-Yeah?

5
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,963
It was a blast.
It was good seeing everybody.

6

Yeah, that was really nice.

7
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,260
I wanted to talk to you about something.

8
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,636
What?

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,388
I know you took it the wrong way,

10
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,933
you know, in the restaurant
when I explained myself about...

11
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,394
-this thing with us.
-Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:07,109
And it kind of bothered me, 'cause it
really didn't feel good the way I said it.

But, um...

how much I love you.

15

-I love you, too.
-And I do have something for you.

I'm sure of what I want, and it's you.

-Let's go in.
-Please.

I'm excited to show you
what we came up with.

49
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,212
Oh, is it different or...

50
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,923
It is, I got inspired
in a different direction,

-so hopefully you like it.

[Catherine] Okay.

55
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,517
So this is not really
what we talked about.

56
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:08,105
No, I kinda got inspired
by the reclaimed wood cabinetry

57
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,649
and took this more in a rustic direction.

58
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:19,908
The staging is definitely not
what I pictured. It's very far from that.

59
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,578
So I did the Navajo blanket,
we have a cowhide rug...

60
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,913
Is that real?

61
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,039
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,875
Is there any way we can get rid of that?

63
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,460
Oh. Are you--

64
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,505
I just feel like, in West Hollywood,
I don't know if people would like that

65
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,757
when they walk in
and have a real cowhide.

66
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,259
Okay. Okay.

67
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:42,848
Something went wrong in our communication,
because this is not what I wanted at all.

68
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,266
Okay.

69
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,270
So I don't know if I'm feeling this.

70
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,569
I'm confused what this bust is.
I don't even know what that is.

71
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,487
So it's a little much for me.

72
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,158
Okay. I really felt like it spoke
to the scale of the room.

73
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,368
To have something that big
and that impactful

74
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,328
that really doesn't drown out
the rest of it.

75
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,581
-I get it. It's not for everyone.
-Yeah.

76
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,042
Don't worry. I can switch it out
and do something a little less.

77
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,503
For the average person,
I think, that's coming in here,

78
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,424
I don't picture them understanding it
and liking it.

79
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,177
-Okay.
-Let's try something a little more simple.

80
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,553
Okay. It's fine.

81
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,222
No problem, but I thought 
it worked really well with this.

82
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:28,018
Sorry, I'm just trying to take it in.
It's not really what we talked about.

83
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,021
I was almost thinking more clean white

84
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,815
rather than more eclectic.

85
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,027
-But I know you said you felt inspired.
-Yeah.

86
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,737
Definitely the rug I would like to...

87
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,282
I felt it was Hollywood and funky,
and when I left here and I was thinking,

88
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,618
originally we talked about, like, 
California beachy.

89
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,912
I feel like that's really done 
sort of everywhere.

90
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:51,458
[chuckles] I was--
I think I lost my voice for a little bit.

91

<i>It's gonna push us back a week</i>

Brett and Jason aren't gonna be happy,

95
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:05,430
so, you know, it's really on me,
and it's stressful for sure.

96
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,266
When the kitchen is done,
I want to see that.

97
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,769
-Okay.
-I want it to stay simple

98
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,604
and just feature 
the beauty of the kitchen,

99
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,232
-but make it lived in like we talked about.
-Okay. Yeah.

100
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,692
Let's see. Uh, I really like
the chair in the corner.

-Oh, good.
-Um...

102
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,197
So maybe just tie in 
some more mid-century modern

103
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,449
and we can connect tomorrow and then...

104
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,326
Whatever doesn't work,
we'll just switch out.

Downstairs you'll see the screening room,
which is gorgeous.

155
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,785
So, as you can see,
you have an attached balcony

156
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,370
to the master suite,

157
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,372
and you can open up these doors

158
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,459
and the sound is absolutely gorgeous.

159
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,879
And so you can see it doesn't even look
like you're in a city right now.

160
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,632
Listen, it sounds like you're on vacation.

161
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,635
This is like
an entertainer's dream out here.

162
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,015
[man] I can see having dinner parties
and stuff like that out here with friends.

163
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,434
So one of my favorite features,

164
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,270
as you walk out, I'm gonna take you
down the elevator,

165
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,898
so you can see how beautiful this is.

166
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,527
You get the fancy exit.
You have to see all the perks.

167
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,487
All right, we'll meet you 
on the main floor.

168
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,492
[chuckles]

169
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,164
Guys, if you just hit 2.

170
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,416
You hit 2 on the elevator.

171
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,502
I don't know.

172
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,006

<i>♪ Come to life ♪</i>

174
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,513
[Heather] Oh, this home's really pretty.

175
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,223
-[Maya] Yeah, it's fun. Yeah.
-It's nice, right?

176
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,517
I haven't seen the inside.
I like the pool area.

177
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,560
-Hi, guys!
-Hi, love.

178
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,228
-Morning.
-How are you?

179
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,730
-Hi!
-Hi!

180
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,608
I called you, I was like, 
"Is she still in bed? Where is she?"

181
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,861
No, I was just...
I had an awesome morning.

182
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,696
Oh! So what happened?

183
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,824
-[Davina] Hey now.
-Oh, my god!

184
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,034
-What?
-[Maya] You got engaged?

185
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,994
-Wait, did you get engaged?
-What?

186
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,330
-Oh, my god.
-Oh, my god.

187
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,247
-Yeah.
-So happy.

188
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,416
This is not my first engagement,

189
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,043
but this one is different.

190
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,171
Uh, the others, we planned it together

191
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:53,802
and it wasn't a surprise.
And this one was a total shock, and...

192
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,054
it's with the right person this time.

193
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,015
<i>And I cannot wait</i>
<i>to be married to this man.</i>

194
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,435
He woke me up and just made me coffee

195
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,313
and was just saying how much he loved me

196
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:09,234
and that he wants to spend the rest
of his life with me, and he proposed.

197
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,404
He said it's moissanite, so it's not
a real diamond right now,

198
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,198
but he's going to save up for it.

199
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,534
He wants to show, like,
how he wants to be with me

200
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,702
and then he's gonna give me
the ring that I deserve.

201
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,871
-Aw!
-When he can get it.

202
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,415
[Maya]<i> Moissanite? Moissanite?</i>

203
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,085
Moist-anite? Maybe it's, like, moist.

204
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:33,967
Moissan-- Moissanite is
naturally occurring silicon carbide,

205
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,885
poly-- God knows what.

206
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:40,265
And it's a rare mineral.
Okay, so it's a mineral.

207
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,685
How do you feel
about the ring being moissanite,

208
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,478
or not a real diamond, per se?

209
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,855
[Heather] Davina!

210
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,274
[Davina]<i> </i>
<i>I was a little shocked that it's fake.</i>

211
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,818
<i>I would rather have a real ring,</i>
<i>me personally.</i>

212
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,737
I think most of the girls 
probably feel the same way.

213
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,740
I think even Mary feels that same way,
but if she likes it,

214
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,992
you know, that's fine.

215
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,369
Well, I mean it doesn't matter
if it's real or fake.

216
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,622
It's meaningful between them, so it's 
kind of rude to say that. [chuckles]

217
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,082
If that's how you feel, that's fine.

218
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,585
[Heather] 
<i>I don't think a diamond defines love.</i>

219
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,713
If you're in a strong, loving relationship
a ring means nothing,

220
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,966
<i>so I think Davina asking that to Mary,</i>

221
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,344
it's very abrasive
and I thought it was super rude.

222
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:22,390
Do you think that this is something
that he had planned the entire time?

223
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,352
Or because the dinner went so bad,
he was like, "Uh-oh, I need a ring!"

224
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,146
-Do you know what I mean?
-I hope not!

225
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,441
No, um, he says that he's been
thinking about it for a while

226
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,568
and planning to do it for a while.

227
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,363
I don't--
But I'm not sure when he bought the ring.

228
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,032
I don't know if he already had it,

229
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,701
or if he decided,
"Yes, I definitely want to do it,"

230
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,869
and-- and bought it.

231
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,413
But he said he's been thinking about it
and he wants to--

232
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,041
-The kid thing...
-Yeah, I was just gonna say...

233
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,792
-Did that change?
-No.

234
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,630
The kid thing has not changed,
but we have decided to put that on hold.

235
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,132
He's 25. He doesn't know what he wants

236
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,842
and how he's gonna feel 
in five or ten years,

237
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,679
but we're just gonna cross that bridge
when we get there.

238
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,599
I mean, I might freeze my eggs
or whatever in case,

239
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,018
just so that the option's there.

240
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,812
I'm really shocked, because it's so fast

241
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,065
after she was
just crying about their relationship.

242
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:17,153
But sometimes these kind of fights 
have a way of shaking things loose,

243
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,073
so I'm hoping that it's
for the right reasons, though,

244
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,575
and he realized in that moment,
like, he could lose her.

245
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,161
-So now we need another party.
-I know!

246
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,747
Christine. Get to work, Christine.

247
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,917
Oh, I thought you meant
my getting engaged. Party? I'm on it!

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,712
Mary, did you have, like, any idea
while you guys were laying in bed--

249
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,674
No. Absolutely not. No.

250
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,884
Someone asked him at the party, remember?
And he was--

251
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:44,055
[Christine] 
I did! I did. Oh, my God, that's right.

252
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,265
Are you guys getting married?

253
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,183
Um...

254
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,643
You asked him that?

255
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,561
Ah! Yes, I asked.

256
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:56,317
I willed your marriage, basically,
through my <i>bruja</i> powers of manifestation.

257
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,570
[Maya] Honestly, just enjoy it, girl.
And congratulations, again.

258
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,488
Thank you.

259
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,199
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

260
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,450
[Heather] Do they know yet?

261
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,745
-Know what? Know what?
-Guess who got engaged?

262
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,872
Shut up!

263
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,084
-You should have let her tell!
-Sorry. Sorry, guys!

264
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,420
That's awesome.

265
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,588
Congratulations.

266
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,132
-Congrats, beautiful.
-Thank you.

267
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,758
Jason, how do you feel about that?

268
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,094
-Oh, come on. I couldn't be happier.
-[Mary] Aw!

269
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,637
I mean, he did beat me to the punch,

270
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,556
but I'm always a couple years
behind the ball.

271
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,349
Yeah, you were a little slow on that one.

272
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:32,186
Jason and I dated about four years ago,
and we dated for about a year.

273
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,939
<i>We broke up because he cannot commit,</i>

274
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,567
but that's just who he his.
And we adore each other,

275
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,737
so, thankfully, we've been able
to be good friends.

276
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,614
I'm just gonna marry the second best girl
on the planet at some point.

277
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:44,782
[girls] Aw.

278
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,953
Jason's definitely genuinely happy
for Romain and I.

279
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,123
<i>He loves both of us, he loves us together,</i>

280
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:56,127
and just truly wants nothing more than us
to be a happy couple.

281
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,505
[Davina] I wanna see the ring you 
get someone if you ever get engaged.

282
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,133
On your deathbed you're like,
uh, I guess I'll finally do it.

283
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,594
Who's next? [chuckles]

284
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,263
No. Not-- No.

285
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:11,017
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
She can't go before me or you. Please.

286
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,520
[vocalizing]

287
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,065
[Jacob] 
You're just crushing it in these heels.

288
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,067
[Christine] 
I'm, like, sinking into the dirt.

289
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,402
-I'm okay with it.
-Oh, that would be bad if you tripped.

290
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,615
<i>♪ Nobody else can do it like me ♪</i>

295
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,460
-Wow.
-[Christine] Do you love it?

296
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,338
[vocalizing]

297
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,048
So come and take a look at these doors.

298
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:46,135
They're absolutely amazing and you can
open them all with the push of a button.

299
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,346
-That's amazing. So they're electric?
-Absolutely.

300
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,100
Just the waterproofing and the glass cost
over a million dollars.

301
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,227
-Wow. That's serious.
-I know. I know.

302
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,479
-I know you're the man for this house.
-This is what I'm liking.

303
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,816
I could look at this view all day,
but can we go take a look at my bedroom?

304
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,443
-Yeah, let's go. Let's go! [chuckles]
-[laughs] Let's go.

305
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,822
-[Christine] This is your master bedroom.
-[Jacob] Okay.

306
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,783
And does the balcony wrap
around the house?

307
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,577
All the way around. It has the same doors,

308
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,872
so you can just set the mood
with the push of a button.

309

-I know you're all about that life.
-Yes.

-Turn on some Marvin Gaye, Chardonnay.

-You should be a rapper.

-I should. I'm in the wrong industry.
-No, you're in the right business.

316
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,557
Showing Jacob a house today is
an interesting experience,

317
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,976
because not only is he a client,
but he's a great friend.

318
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,187
We actually went to high school together,
and I've known him for years.

319
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,564
Jacob's always been really smart.

320
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:44,193
He made it really big in the tech industry
and it's nice to see how far he's come.

00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,363
-This view is just...
-Yeah. It's really amazing.

-[Jacob] Damn

Just this rooftop alone is
4,000 square feet.

-Yeah.

I don't even have words for it.

I can see myself coming
to a lot of your parties here.

332
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,018
Yes. Yes. You should show up
every Thursday with a glass of rosé.

-I like that.
-For me.

-Rosé all day.
-Can we negotiate that in the deal?

335
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,981
We should negotiate that
in the contract.

-Okay, let's do it.
-[laughs]

You can afford it, and you deserve it.

-We've come a long way from high school.
-[chuckles] We really have.

345
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,546
And I never thought that we'd be
in a position to, you know,

have you sell me a house like this.

Yeah. Isn't that crazy?

348

Well, now that I'm in town
we should grab drinks sometime.

Yeah. He's so good-looking 
it makes me a little bit uncomfortable.

453
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,777
[laughs]

454
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,988
But I'm like, "That's a good-looking
white boy." When did this happen?

455
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,448
[laughs]

456
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,949
-You didn't see it?
-No!

457
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,993
Yeah, so we-- Yeah, we got engaged.

458
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,330
And we started planning,
um, trying to plan--

459
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,415
-I want your opinion.
-All grown up. Look at you.

460
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,209
-I know.
-I'm very proud of you.

461
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,630
Thank you. So, let me know
if you want to put in an offer.

462
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,466
I def-- I guess, maybe, like,
do you have time next week?

463
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,927
-Yeah, let me know when.
-I definitely want to bring Walker in.

464
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,595
-Perfect.
-Um...

465
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,139
-In the meantime, I'll let you know...
-Get his blessing.

466
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,725
-...if anyone else, like, is interested...
-Please do.

467
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,145
...and is writing an offer
so we can get yours in.

468
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,231
Yeah, so I can, um, put a hit out on them.

469
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,816
[laughs] Exactly.

470
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,984
If somebody tries to mess with this
I'm gonna beat they ass.

471
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,069
[Mary laughs]

472
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,874
-Hey, girl.
-Hi, ladies.

473
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,960
-[Heather] How are you?
-[Maya] Hey!

474
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,253
Are you ready for this meeting?

475
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,755
God, I know, I feel like we have
a lot to talk about.

476
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:24,051
What do you girls think about, like,
the whole Mary and Romain engagement?

477
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,429
I'm just so protective of her,
because, you know, she's my best friend

478
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,348
and I've known her for years
and I just want to make sure

479
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,725
that he's in it for the right reason.

480
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,644
What other reason would he be in it?

481
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,188
Well, you know,
she's a very successful woman.

482
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,649
You know, who wouldn't want
to be with someone like that?

483
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,818
The only thing that scared me was
about the kid thing.

484
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,028
She said, "We'll cross that bridge
when we get there."

485
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,365
Those conversations should probably come,
like, sooner in the relationship.

486
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:50,786
You know, he is young. He is 25.
Like, does he really know what he wants?

487
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,079
You're married. You're married.

488
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,833
When a guy puts a ring on your finger,
it's that security that you feel, right?

489
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,376
-Like, it's like--
-It is, it is.

490
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,920
It's a great feeling.
Like, I don't know. I don't know.

491
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,047
-I feel like--
-Christine knows.

492
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,133
[Chrishell] 
Wait, I heard you say that earlier.

493
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,760
You-- I didn't know that.
She told me that the other day.

494
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,346
-You've been engaged three times?
-Yeah, I was raised Catholic,

495
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,056
and you never get divorced.

496
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,602
So that was something that was really
important to me and I really cherished it.

497
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:19,231
And I just felt wasn't right. These guys 
were nice, great, stand-up guys,

498
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,275
but I just didn't want
to end up breaking their hearts

499
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,152
and I didn't see myself with them
in the long term.

500
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,278
So I kind of let them go.

501
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,907
I'm not really that shocked that Christine 
has been engaged three times.

502
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,367
I mean, look at her. She's beautiful.

503
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,536
But maybe it sounds like she's
a little too picky.

504
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,291
She's trying to, like, <i>Weird Science</i> a guy
and kind of create the perfect man.

505
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,500
Good luck with that.

506
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,836
-[Chrishell] Did you keep the rings?
-I could never keep the ring.

507
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,464
And not to mention 
it just doesn't feel right to me.

508
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,841
Speaking of rings, hey girl!

509
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,927
-How are you?
-Good.

510
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,805
What's it-- What did I miss?

511
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,390
We're talking about marriage and rings.

512
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,267
-Oh, okay.
-[Jason] Team.

513
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,979
We're all here, so let's start today's
meeting. We have a lot to talk about.

514
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,148
Let me go over some general things,

515
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,651
and then we'll go over
some more specific listings.

516
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,986
I wanna hear what everyone's doing.
In terms of commission,

517
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,447
I want to be pushing five and a half,
six percent total.

518
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,533
I know there's a lot of people 
taking listings for less,

519
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,410
but you get what you pay for.

520
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:16,413
I just don't want to see listings
coming in at five percent.

521
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:20,250
Our standing right now,
150 million dollars in active listings.

522
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:23,420
It's a little below our average. 
I like to keep it close to 200 million.

523
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,256
Just want to put the bug
in everyone's ear, let's pick it up.

524
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,550
So a couple of development issues quickly.

525
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,429
Uh, Davina, Jason, and I had a good 
meeting with the owner of the Lion Lofts.

526
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:37,393
Yeah, 82 units, contemporary,
beautiful property, very architectural,

527
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,812
in Hollywood,
just slightly north of Sunset.

528
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,480
Gorgeous. Yeah, it's ready to go.

529
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,817
I've said this a million times, but you
get out of it what you put into it.

530
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,861
And Davina's an example
of getting massive buildings.

531
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,155
-Congrats!
-Thank you.

532
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,198
[Davina] Thanks, you guys.

533
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,034
-Christine.
-I have a client of mine, Jacob.

534
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:58,414
Him and I went to high school together.
I showed him Hillside, and he liked it.

535
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,000
Nobody else has shown that yet
but Christine, so good work.

536
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,459
-Yeah, good work.
-I'm really excited.

537
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,336
Um, it seemed like it could be big enough.

538
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,714
All of you, try to bring people
up to our listing.

539
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,258
Christine, well done. Heather,
tell me what's going on with you.

540
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:13,012
I have 1490 Sunset Plaza.
We're just finishing the landscaping.

541
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,557
I met with the staging company the other 
day, and there was a little goof.

542
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,228
The style just was not working,
and it should be up on the market soon.

543
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,896
I don't mean to put you on the spot
in front of everybody,

544
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,026
but if this was done right the first time,
it would've been on the market already.

545
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,404
-So...
-Hold on, at what price point?

546
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,073
Five-point-five million,
just under 4,000 square feet.

547
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,325
So if anyone has a buyer...

548
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,869
I actually met a buyer,

549
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,621
and they're looking for something.
That one's at six,

550
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,498
-and they're looking between four and six.
-Perfect!

551
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,125
-Look at that!
-Let's be in touch, then.

552
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,502
Wait for it to be staged, and the hour
after it's staged, get them in there.

553
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,504
-So make sure that happens. Okay.
-Okay.

554
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,923
-Good job, new girl.
-Thanks, mama.

555
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,717
We also need to talk about this girl

556
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,677
and what we're doing
for her engagement party.

557
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,929
-[alll] Yes!
-Yes! What do you want to do?

558
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,682
I'm so open.
I think a winery could be fun.

559
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,768
-I love wineries.
-Winery, boat...

560
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,436
-Let's have it at my house.
-Oh, I don't know.

561
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,438
-Yeah, that would be nice.
-That would be cool.

562
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,608
-All right, we'll figure it out.
-Should we talk to Romain, too, maybe?

563
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,860
Nah. Nah. No, no, no, no.

564
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,112
We're just planning our party.
Romain will be there.

565
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,238

-[Christine] Hi.
-Hey, how are you?

576
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,932
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you. Hi.

577
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,392
-You look nice.
-Thank you. You do, too.

578
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,978
-You smell nice tonight.
-Thank you, I showered for you.

579
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,105
[laughs]

580
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,941
-You work today?
-Yes. Calls and meetings,

581
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,859
but I'm happy to be here with you.

582
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:51,944
Yeah, I know.

583
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,279
-What about you?
-I'm waiting on these buyers

584
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:57,449
to pick between three houses,
and hopefully they'll choose my listing.

585
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,118
-Okay.
-Thank you.

586
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,160
Sure.

587
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,954
-You got the fancy drink.
-[Christine] Yeah.

588
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,664
-Cheers.
-Looks like a science experiment.

589
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,873
Thank you so much.

590
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,334
-Cheers.
-Well, cheers to us in LA.

591
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,837
I know, and cheers to causing trouble.

592
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,215
-Can I try it?
-Yeah.

593
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,175
[Jacob] You look good drinking it.

594
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,305
I love it. Right?

595
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,890
[coughs] It's good.

596
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,601
I just want to pay people 
to come around with dry ice

597
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,396
and just put it in my drinks all the time,
so everything I'm drinking--

598
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,398
It's a lot when you're trying
to drink it, though.

599
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,983
-I like it. I'm okay with it.
-It's a lot.

600
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,067
[both] So...

601
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,278
-Jinx!
-[chuckles]

602
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,822
-So you go first.
-You owe me another margarita.

603
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,991
[laughs] Okay. Um...

604
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,284
I was gonna just ask, um,

605
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,579
so how has, you know, 
the dating scene been in here LA.

606
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,290
Honestly, it's a little weird.
I've been on the apps and stuff,

607
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,792
gotten a lot of strange messages. Um...

608
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,795
I can't imagine being a girl
and being on the other side of that.

609
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,423
I feel like in LA
people have so many options

610
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,552
that they just don't commit
to the possibility of one person,

611
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,888
so they're like, 
"Oh, let me see what's out there."

612
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,431
Well, you do really have to commit,

613
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,391
and I feel like a lot
of stuff happens last minute.

614
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,476
-Yeah. Thank you.
-[Jacob] Awesome.

615
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,563
It's just hard when you're a girl,
because obviously you have to get ready,

616
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,648
like, it takes time.
I'm not a last minute person.

617
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,318
-Do you know what I mean?
-I think a lot of people would think

618
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,447
that you were like 
the cheerleader-type in high school.

619
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,782
You hung out
with an interesting group of people.

620
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,911
Yeah, I had so many, like,  nerd friends.

621
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:27,122
And I will continue to apologize for this,

622
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,834
but I saw other people kind of being mean
to you, which was not right.

623
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:35,255
The hardest thing I went through in high
school was knowing that I was different.

624
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,299
<i>I was always really tall.</i>

625
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,302
I had a growth spurt and I was, 
like, the tallest girl in my class.

626
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,554
I was, like, I don't know,
probably like five-eight.

627
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,349
<i>And I had long, blonde hair, </i>
<i>and I feel like girls were jealous of me.</i>

628
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,601
<i>And guys liked me, </i>
<i>but wanted to make fun of me.</i>

629
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,938
<i>I think there's a certain, like,</i>
<i>perception of high school</i>

630
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:55,150
and I think anyone that thinks outside
of the box or acts differently,

631
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,527
you know,
isn't necessarily treated so well.

632
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,948
You were so much ahead of the game,

633
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:05,160
mentally, and knew that,
hey, being yourself was cool.

634
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,913
'Cause not a lot of people 
are comfortable in their own skin,

635
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,624
so you kind of figured that out
quicker than most people.

636
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,794
But if I wasn't treated totally unfairly,

637
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,172
I wouldn't work as hard today.
I just wouldn't.

638
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,925
You know, I've always been attracted
to you. Obviously, you're beautiful.

639
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,512
I just feel like you've been showing me
houses and it's been reminding me

640
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,765
of how well we get along
and that's tough to find.

641
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,643
I think that next year's 
gonna be amazing for you.

642
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,103
I'm back in LA. [laughs]

643
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:35,274
[laughs] You're like, "It's gonna be 
amazing for you, because I'm here."

644
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,650
[Jacob] Yeah.

645
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,235
What do you got going this weekend?

646
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,237
I have a date tomorrow night.

647
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,117
Do you?

648
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,244
Okay.

649
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,996
Interesting.

650
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,581
-Are you jealous?
-A little bit. A little bit.

651
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,253
<i>♪ If you wanna say it </i>
<i>I'm good ♪</i>

654
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,887
[Jason] Just getting stuff out on 
the table if you want to help. Bread and--

655
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,473
I'm gonna throw some pasta
up in these bowls.

656
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,226
Oh, this is all bread. I don't know
how much bread we're gonna eat.

657
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,021
[Brett] Why don't we just put in the oven
and make it look like we cooked it?

658
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:18,025
-'Cause they'll definitely know better.
-[Brett] Yeah, that was sarcasm.

659
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,945
-Looks good, though. I'm getting hungry.
-Yeah, it'll be nice.

660
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,905
Have a little toast for Romain and Mary.

661
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,908
-That looks good.
-This is like the most cooking I've done.

662
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,368
This isn't cooking, dude.

663
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,662
-Yeah that was again sarcasm.
-Oh.

664
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,831
[Jason] Let's just get 
all the meat and fish on here. Can we?

665
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:36,918
Meat and fish together doesn't look right.
Or sound right.

666
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,087
Can, uh-- 
Can I just do that that way, bud?

667
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,756
The wood is what we got.

668
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,841
-Oh, what's up, girl?
-Hi, how are you?

669
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,842
[Jason] What's up?

670
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,469
-Hi.
-Hi. Muah.

671
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,138
That's wonderful. Look at you guys.
Do you need help?

672
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,558
Yeah, Jason wants to put steak and fish
on the same platter. Is that a good idea?

673
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,519
Yeah, I don't know if you should steak
and the fish on the same one.

674
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,229
Then the steaks gonna be fishy.

675
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,190
You can put it on 
the wood right there if you want.

676
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:02,069
-[Chrishell] Hello.
-Hey, sweetheart. How are you?

677
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,154
Oh, this is so nice!

678
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,448
-[Jason] Oh, yeah, you've never been here!
-[Chrishell] No!

679
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,992
-[Jason] Oh, my gosh.
-[Chrishell] Oh, this is beautiful.

680
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:13,205
I love that the company gets together
and has dinners, like, at Jason's house.

681
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,208
<i>I think that's awesome. </i>
<i>Even though they're so successful,</i>

682
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,170
<i>it's still boutique enough that he can</i>
<i>have everybody over for dinner.</i>

683
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,632
<i>And I just like seeing people</i>
<i>outside of the work environment.</i>

684
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,217
[Brett] We should get some drinks.

685
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,761
-[Brett] Yeah, we should get some wine.
-[Jason] Yeah, we should.

686
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,680
-[Heather] You want some wine?
-[Brett] It's hot, man. You got AC?

687
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:34,351
Alexa, it's hot as fuck in here.
Turn the air conditioning down.

688
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,812
That's not how it works. 
Alexa-- Can I do it?

689
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,107
Alexa, set 
the living room temperature to 69.

690
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,025
[Maya] All right, 69, of course.

691
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,819
-[Jason] Chrishell, wine?
-Yes, please.

692
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,570
-[Jason] White?
-[Mary] Honey, I'm home!

693
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,489
-Who is it?
-Get them, guys. Get them.

694
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,075
-Hello.
-Hey, what's up, guys?

695
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,493
My babies!

696
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,370
What's up, bud? Good to see you, man.

697
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,831
-Hi, sweetheart.
-How are you?

698
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,333
I'm so excited for you guys.

699
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,670
-[Maya] Cheers, you guys.
-Cheers to Mary and Romain.

700
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,338
-Yay!
-Thank you!

701
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,507
-Cheers, you guys.
-Thank you.

702
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,551
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

703
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,846
-You guys, congratulations.
-You'll make the most beautiful bride.

704
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,974
Oh, I thought you were gonna say babies.
I was like, "Whoa."

705
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,059
Oh, that too. Oh, wait.

706
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,147
Do me a favor, grab the food,
and let's all get to the table, yeah?

707
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,232
Where should we sit?
Do you have name tags?

708
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,191
[Maya] Can I be over here?

709
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,902
Romain and Mary, you come down
this way so I can sit with you guys.

710
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,363
Is this the Last Supper?

711
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,575
Please feel free to spill on the floor,
'cause the kiddos are hungry too.

712
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,577
I thought you we'd say
'cause your maid's coming tomorrow.

713
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,246
-That's something you would totally say.
-[Davina] Yeah, me too.

714
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,414
We get Branzino.

715
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,208
[Brett] Romain, you better get on that
steak 'cause that's all there is for you.

716
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,712
[Christine] If Heather did not have 
a boyfriend, would you date Heather?

717
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:48,550
No. I want everyone single, because then
they focus on work more. To be honest.

718
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,302
Guys, take note, okay?

719
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,887
-[Davina] You guys want salad?
-[Chrishell] Yay.

720
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,929
Okay, that's it. That's it.

721
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,599
Let's start with wine, then we'll move on
to the hard stuff.

722
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,893
-[Jason] Just tequila shots.
-Oh, I don't drink tequila.

723
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,769
Well, you're gonna have to.

724
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,940
Christine! How are things with Jacob?

725
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,276
We had an amazing date at Ocean Prime.

726
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,069
He's like, "What are you doing tomorrow?"

727
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,780
I was like, "Oh, I have another
date tomorrow." And I was like--

728
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,240
-Wait, what?
-Oh, no...

729
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,034
As soon as I said that, I was like,

730
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,745
why would I have told him about my date
with someone else?

731
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,498
Like, he's too nice.
She needs, like, a douchebag

732
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,583
and then-- then she gonna be turned on.

733
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,919
No, no, no,
I really like boring, finance--

734
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,172
It's weird. Like, I don't like people
that are like me. No, seriously, I don't.

735
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,132
I don't. He's cute and sweet.

736
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,927
I mean, did you guys feel 
like there was an instant like

737
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,221
-"I want to kiss this person"?
-Say yes.

738
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,222
Yeah.

739
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,474
What made you finally decide
to pop the question?

740
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,726
Oh, about the age?

741
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,977
About the age? No!

742
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,896
[laughs]

743
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,398
-No.
-About getting married. Getting married.

744
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,151
-About getting married, bro.
-Remember, the engagement, that part.

745
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,029
Popped your question, as to, 
what made you ask me to marry you?

746
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,533
Well, it was, you know, everything. Um...

747
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,244
We moved together.

748
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:00,997
-Basically, he wanted to have sex.
-I wanna hear his answer. Don't be rude.

749
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,458
Shh, don't say that.

750
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,210
I wanna hear his answer.

751
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,922
We moved together, you know,
living together and...

752
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,051
And then Mary put a gun in my head
and told me it's about time.

753
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,803
You don't live no more.

754
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,430
-I want to hear what he's saying.
-I know, me, too.

755
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,183
She puts a gun to my head. Okay. Ah.

756
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,519
Stop making me horny, guys. Please. Okay?

757
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,272
I want to hear the sweetness
that he was saying.

758
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,482
I just wanted to move forward. Uh...

759
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,192
I mean, we're working a lot together, so--

760
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,279
But you know if you marry Mary
then you also marry Jason, right?

761
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,364
You know, it comes as a package.

762
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,117
Well, I've got one girl
and two brothers now.

763
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,744
We wanna hear the romance
and we wanna hear the love

764
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:43,331
and that's not what he was giving us.
Come on Romain, give us something.

765
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,750
I want to know which side
of the aisle am I gonna stand on?

766
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,502
Am I gonna be best man or best ma'am?

767
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:51,089
I think you should be on my side.
We do share dogs.

768
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:56,803
Wait, so Zelda and Nico are his babies,
but then, is he step-daddy or daddy now?

769
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:00,682
Jason and I got Zelda together
when Romain and I were together.

770
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,850
Wait a minute, I'm confused.

771
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,644
So you got Zelda after you
and Romain were together,

772
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,564
-but you got him with Jason.
-Yeah.

773
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,859
It worked so well sharing Nico
that we just adopted another dog.

774
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,194
And how long did you and Jason date?

775
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,363
I mean, it depends 
if you include the break-up period

776
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,450
-Six months to a year.
-Yeah, we had a lingering kind of period.

777
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,243
We lived together for...

778
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,078
Yeah, we lived here
for a few months together.

779
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,663
-You lived here together?
-Yeah.

780
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,458
[chuckles] Oh, my God.

781
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,835
You guys are like the-- That's so funny.

782
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,671
Not only could I never be
that close to an ex,

783
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,465
I wouldn't want to be that close to an ex.

784
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,343
<i>Every time Jason and Mary </i>
<i>get a little, like, friendly,</i>

785
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:40,305
I look to Romain, 'cause I'm waiting 
to see if, like, does this bother you

786
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,932
<i>or are you jealous?</i>
<i>I always do, like, out of habit.</i>

787
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:48,104
I look to him, 'cause that would make
me mad, but he always seems fine about it.

788
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,940
We broke up but still dated.

789
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,526
We're learning a lot. 
It's very interesting.

790
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,694
Interesting history, but it works.

791
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:55,695
[Christine] Crishell. 
Why did you break up?

792
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:58,990
And I found 
the most amazing man that's like--

793
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,451
I know everyone gives him shit 
because how young he is,

794
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,871
but he... I mean, who... Even 40...
I know, like who--

795
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,373
Since you guys are so cool,

796
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,042
I feel like its not weird to ask.
Why did you break up?

797
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,211
That's probably more on me.

798
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,588
[Maya] Commitment issue. [coughs]

799
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,049
What's monogamy? [coughs]
I thought it was monopoly.

800
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,385
There was, like, a transitional period.

801
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,096
Poor Romain.
Do you want to hear this, or no?

802
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,014
We were good friends before,
and we're much closer now.

803
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,641
[Mary] We're much closer now.

804
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,017
It's gotta be awkward for Romain.

805
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:30,021
-Brett hates talking about relationships.
-I'm not a super jealous person,

806
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,524
but I wouldn't be able to be
in Romain's position.

807
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:36,236
That's exactly why I just asked him,
"Do you want to hear this?"

808
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,989
I mean, I wouldn't.
TMI. I don't need all this detail.

809
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:45,495
This situation, I couldn't handle. No.

810
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,456
[Brett] All right, 
that's enough talking about that.

811
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,209
Forty-five minutes 
about relationships, come on.

812
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,045
All right, let's talk about something 
else. Let's talk about the Raiders!

813
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,047
-Don't be a dick.
-The Raiders?

814
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,217
Should we clean our shit?

815
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,343
Yeah. Let's clean up, guys.

816
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:04,556
You know what, I used to be a waitress,
so I'm gonna clear some of these plates.

817
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,600
That was my biggest thing. Oops, sorry.

818
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,020
Okay, I've lost touch, guys. 
I've lost my...

819
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,815
No, wait, wait, wait, the dogs are like,
they're on it.

820
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,109
Don't worry. Get it, Zelda. Get it.

821
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,360
I've lost my touch.

822
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,486
[Maya chuckles]

823
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,657
-[Jason] I'm gonna go get my wine.
-[Maya] I'm gonna sit down.

824
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,076
Yeah, guys, I got the fire on outside
if you wanna go.

825
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,369
[Heather] That's nice.

826
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,621
Who else is drinking? Are you guys not?

827
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,373
What'd you want to talk to me about?

828
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:34,711
I just want to talk to you
because I feel like it's really fast,

829
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,337
and I just want to make sure--

830
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,048
-What? Me and Romain?
-You and Romain getting engaged.

831
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,300
[Mary] Seriously?

832
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,719
[Christine] You've been married 
a few times, so I just, like--

833
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,930
-Oh, thanks, but--
-I mean, I just want to make sure...

834
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,849
Okay, there's still-- Yeah, but okay.

835
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,310
-Yes, I have, but--
-...that he has the right intentions.

836
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,061
-Like, I love you.
-They were different situations,

837
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,272
in both of those and I was, like--

838
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:59,986
You're my best friend, I just want
to make sure that this is it. You know?

839
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,865
He is everything that I've wanted.

840
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,283
He's everything that's right.

841
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,243
But I want to make sure
that he has good intentions.

842
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:10,288
Like, you're 
a very successful young woman.

843
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,290
I'm like, is he taking advantage of you?

844
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,126
He's never asked me for anything. Ever.

845
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,962
I just want to make sure that,
like, you've thought about all this,

846
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:21,424
because, you know, you came to the office
the other day and you were so sad

847
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,551
about your conversation about kids,
and I was like,

848
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,596
these are the conversations
I would be having on first dates.

849
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,308
And that's just me, but, you know, 
so I was just like, I want to make sure

850
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,478
that my best friend, my coworker,

851
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:39,192
my, like, sister is, you know, 
like, thinking straight. That's all.

852
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:43,488
I just don't understand. This is supposed
to be a celebration. We're all happy.

853
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,659
What has he ever done 
to make you even question

854
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,203
that he has bad intentions?

855
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,039
He had apprehensions 
about your relationship and kids.

856
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:57,752
It's crazy to me that you guys, you know,
were on such different pages about that

857
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:58,795
and now you're engaged.

858
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,131
It was a misunderstanding 
about him saying, like, it works for now.

859
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,843
That was just lost in translation,
the kid thing.

860
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,428
Yeah, we don't have it figured out.
You're right. We don't.

861
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:11,266
He's too young to know what he wants,
so I'm not worried about that.

862
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,310
If he's too young to know what he wants,
is he too young to know

863
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,895
what he wants in terms of marriage?

864
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,606
For now, we are happy, we love each other,
we want to be together.

865
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,651
But do you know what I mean
when I say that I have doubt?

866
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,571
-How many times have you...
-I'm confused, I just want to make sure--

867
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:28,741
...like, been upset about a dude
that ends up being a complete douchebag?

868
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:32,537
He is the one,
and I want you just to be happy for me.

869
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,206
Imagine that places that you
and I have come from,

870
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,460
where you and I were both on the floor
crying, upset about guys.

871
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,838
-It's like-- It makes me sad.
-They were the wrong guys.

872
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,339
They were the wrong guys.

873
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:46,342
-I wanna make sure he's the right guy.
-How often have you seen me cry--

874
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,260
Two days ago!

875
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,347
-That was a misunderstanding.
-I'm, you know, worried about you.

876
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,310
Christine, when was the last time
you were in a relationship?

877
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,563
Like, a proper relationship
where you can even talk to me about this?

878
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,273
-That's... up.
-It's true.

879
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,359
Seriously, just let us be happy.

880
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,528
You know what Mary, like, do your thing.
You know?

881
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,448
I just can't. I want to be happy 
for you right now, but I can't.

882
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,451
-I just, like, can't do this right now.
-Nice.

883
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,707
Guys, I'm so sorry, I have to leave,
but I had an amazing time.

884
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,001
-[Brett] Really?
-Yeah, you got better things to do?

885
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,046
<i>♪ I know with depression ♪ </i>

886
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,340
<i>♪ It's getting cold... ♪ </i>

887
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,551
-[Maya] What happened, Mary?
-Oh, nothing.

888
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,638
-Whatever. Hey, baby.
-My love.

889
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,723
-[Jason] Everything cool?
-Yeah.
